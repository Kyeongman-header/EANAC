Which is why Ray loved his . Where most saw a terrifying ghoul , Ray saw a comforting promise . A guarantee that he would not have to exist forever . When his wife was killed in the car crash , Ray had seen in the rearview his own eyes , his own fear reflected as his wife 's reaper came barreling in from behind .", "In just a moment he realized it all ; they were due a freak accident , a change of fate . And then , grotesquely , a smaller reaper , its ghostly feet beating a silent *pitter-patter* , arm outstretched as it struggled to keep up with its mother . His daughter in the back . She was being cooed at by her laughing mother , gurgling happily in her carseat , blissful in her unknowing . What could Ray do ? *WHAT COULD HE DO ? * A thousand thoughts crossed his mind . *Prevent it somehow . Change fate . Swerve off the road . Offer your life as collateral . Pray for their earthly salvation . Something , something ! *   She looked to him , one last time . In that final moment . Her eyes met his , laughing creases changing to worry in slow motion as she saw the unbridled terror in his eyes , he could see everything , he knew as her mouth begin to move in formation of the question **he knew** , it was too late , too late , and he would never forget . He could see it now in his mind in perfect detail , wind streaming in the half-open window , playing lazily with that lock of hair that she could never keep tied back . Her lovely chest beneath her white sweater expanding ever so slightly , unfettered by the seatbelt she hated so much to wear . The hazel-flecked green of her questioning eyes in the light , the pupils contracting in turn as the sun flowed over one before the other . Her soft lips just beginning to form his name , asking him to protect her , save them , keep her safe : his wife , the mother of his child , his only love and the only thing he ever loved , *save us Ray , save our baby* and yet he failed her , just as with everything else , he failed her too and her would never forgive himself . *Remember , Ray . Memorize it . Remember what you did . Never forget . *   Just before the impact he could not find his reaper .", "He knew what was coming and he did not want to live , without them there would be nothing to live for and he knew he could not save them and he wanted to die . But his reaper was not there . It was not there and then the impact came , his world ending in a great explosive conglomeration of crashing glass and screeching metal and shrieking twisting screaming tearing and then blood , theirs and his mixed up slick and smelling of iron and heat in the smoldering car . She had gone through the windshield . There was a gash above his head pouring blood but remarkably his limbs were intact and he crawled out of the overturned car to find her , cutting his hands and knees on the crystal shards that lay in a carpet around the vehicle . His ears were ringing . As he failed to stand , he realized he could hear the baby crying weakly . He tried the door but it would n't budge . He surrendered his broken hands and pulled with all his might , the glass cutting into his fingers and bleeding down and around the handle . Nothing . He was raising his elbow to smash it into the glass , and then felt a ghastly chill . It was passing through him . Her reaper . Bony arms outstretched , wisps of ethereal smoke trailing behind as it moved to fulfill its grotesque destiny . He thought his heart stopped . He could n't move . And then he raced to her , that white smudge on the concrete , falling to his knees and pulling her into his lap , her sweater curiously untouched except where his bloody fingers colored it red . He willed her eyes to open , wanting to wake her more than anything , wanting to have one more day with her , one more hour , one more look into those eyes , one more kiss . She was scarcely breathing . Her hand was limp in his . He tried to speak , but all that came out was an anguished sob . The reaper was only feet away now . He had seconds . `` Please ! '' he sobbed to nothing and no one . `` Please , please , god , take me instead , leave her . Take me ! '' There was no answer . The damned thing was n't even 5 feet away now . He lifted her into his arms and tried to run . His boat shoes had long since flown off , and the broken glass crunched deeply into his feet . He hobbled along , unwilling to accept the inevitable . Looking over his shoulder he saw the reaper keeping its grim pace , arms outstretched and dead eyes unseeing . `` Damn you ! '' he snarled , as he struggled onwards . `` Damn you , you -- you fucking monster ! You *freak* ! Fuck you , fuck you , I 'll kill you somehow , I swear it , please do n't , please -- '' and as his threats devolved into pleas he slipped , falling to his knees . He gave up . It was done . He had made it barely 10 feet . There was nothing left he could do . Faintly , he heard the baby crying . The reaper came on . It had never fallen behind . Finally it reached them and gently , gently , took her soul in its arms , its bony limbs passing through Ray 's own , and disappeared .", "In Ray 's arms , his wife let out her last breath . He was finished . He wished fervently to die right there . And then he realized where he was kneeling . Gently he laid his wife on the ground , clearing away the debris . He laid his last kiss on her bloody forehead , then stood . Ray stepped on the running board of the delivery vehicle and opened the drivers side door . Almost comically , out clanked several beer cans , *one , two , three* . Inside the cab of the white box truck was a very clearly inebriated man . He stared wide-eyed at the destruction he had caused . Ray grabbed him by the collar and pulled him out roughly to the pavement . The man fell hard on his face . He looked up , arms raised . `` Look man , I 'm sorry , '' he began . `` I -- I do n't know what happened , it just -- '' Ray began beating him .", "With every punch he imagined he was killing himself . Tears streamed down his face . Every strike drove shards of glass deeper into his hands . He focused on the pain and ignored the man 's steadily weakening pleas . When the man raised his arms to defend himself , Ray kicked him viciously until he felt bones in his feet break . Then he began punching him again . Out of the corner of his eye , Ray noticed something . There was a reaper creeping nearer . He was beginning to tire , but with every punch he threw , the harbinger of death jolted closer . Finally , he had to stop , exhausted and panting , doubling over , hands pouring blood all over his knees . The man was a gory mess ; nose broken , face swollen , making small mewling noises between gasps for air through his bloodied mouth . A few of his teeth had fallen out . The man 's reaper was a few feet away now . 15 , 20 maybe . Ray caught his breath for some moments , then plodded with red-ribboned feet over to a piece of curb that had been broken free by the crash . He lifted it above his head with his tortured hands and brought it down on the defenseless man once , twice , three times , each with a sickening `` *thunk* . '' With every blow the reaper reappeared closer , and as the man 's skull broke open from the final strike , it embraced his body with its arms and then lifted off , disappearing with his soul , leaving the expired shell behind . Ray had no tears left . He crawled over to his wife 's body and held her in his lap , stroking her hair , staring into the flames of the burning car as the sirens grew closer . The baby stopped crying ."], "summaries": ["After a journey of uncertain purpose, Ray finds himself contemplating life at the edge of a 100-story lookout as the sun paints the sky in pastel hues.", "A man contemplates his difficult life and the presence of his comforting reaper amidst society's futile attempts to escape death.", "A man faces a moment of impending tragedy as he grapples with the desperate need to save his family from a fatal accident, haunted by the realization that his attempts to alter fate may come too late.", "A man faces a tragic car crash, desperately trying to save his loved one as a grim reaper hovers near, ultimately taking her soul as he collapses in defeat, hearing the baby crying nearby.", "In a moment of grief and anger, Ray seeks revenge on the man responsible for his wife's death.", "A man experiences intense internal conflict while unleashing brutal violence on another person, haunted by the looming presence of a reaper drawing near.

The public transportation was and still is fantastic , so I was alone when I rode the double decker bus back home . When I got to the nearest station to my home , I began to walk towards the subway tunnel , which led to the pathway to my house . The path to my house was under this long canopy of trees , and was squeezed into a thin lane between the trees and a wall right behind the trees - basically you could only walk on this path . The path extended past this sort of village place , then went on towards a cul-de-sac . The cul-de-sac was where I lived , and took about an hour to get to . It was a long but nice walk .", "Unfortunately there were a lot of wild dogs around that area , and I had an almost pathological fear of dogs ( I think I was bitten by one when I was really young and I kept that fear ) . At that moment in time though I only ever heard the dogs ' barks ; at that moment I had never seen a wild dog .", "Today though , I spotted a dog lying on the pathway in front of me . First reaction was to be quiet and just step over it , since I did n't have enough space to go around . But when I actually got to the point of doing the act , I stopped . It was probably smarter to just wait for the dog to wake up and leave . So I turned around and began to walk back . But then I heard growling behind me . Somehow I had woken up the dog ( I think I stepped on it 's tail by accident ) , and it was mad at me . So , faced with the danger of being bitten , and with faded memories of other encounters with dogs rising up , I chose flight and began to run . Of course , my stubby legs could n't outrun the fully grown dog , and it caught up to me quickly . Realising the situation I was in , I decided to turn around and fight the dog .", "So I promptly tried to punch its nose with my right hand , but instead got it caught in the dog 's mouth . Fear of the dog was n't ruling me anymore , and I bit the dog back . Dog whimpers and runs away , but leaves me with a bleeding hand - and the possibility of a disease . It also hurt a lot and I was still an hour away from home . I was happy that my bag was safe and sound though . So I began to walk home .", "But about five to ten minutes after I began walking , I met a nanny ( they 're pretty common in Hong Kong ) . She had headgear , so she was from Indonesia . She was also pulling an empty little cart that was probably meant for groceries . When I walked up to her she made a gasping sound and began talking Cantonese to me . I was an expat 's child though and did n't understand . She then dropped her little trolley , and lifted me up in both of her arms . She stuttered out the words , `` Come with me , I have bandaids . '' I just nodded and let myself be carried off down the pathway .", "She lived in the village that the path passed by , and so only took a minute or so to reach . She brought me into her employer 's house and sat me down . She gave me a phone and motioned to call and said , `` Parents . '' Then she went into another room while I called my parents . I told my mom what happened , she sounded flustered and told me that she would come pick me up in her car . The nanny then came back from the room she was in and was holding some alcohol , some paper towels , and those long white , wrapping bandages . She wiped off the blood that caked my hand , and added a liberal amount of the medicinal alcohol . She honestly added too much in my opinion . It honestly stung more than the bite ... Anyways , she then wrapped those bandages around and told me to sit tight for my parents . My parents arrived , and I left .", "I guess some people might say everything the nanny did was expected , and that anyone would do such a thing . But she could have easily ignored me , and that 's what I probably would have done : I would think the person does n't want my help because that person is n't asking . The nanny 's speed of reaction , and her willingness to do all those medicinal acts will probably always be stuck in my mind . Even if what she did was minimal . She was just 'someone 's in trouble - > must help .

Just get off my case for a minute ! ”   Mentioning my family only made me feel worse . They were the only reason that I had got myself into this mess in the first place .

The conversation between my companions had always been savage and violent , to the extent they would often fight until they were exhausted , with no amount of intervention able to stop them once they began , you really did just have to let it take its course once that occurred .

'dont answer the question Ghon ' i said 'anything more will set old ticker here off ' .

The ministry had always attempted to group and label abilities to better identify them , but because of the slight difference in each individuals they often fit into multiple areas , which is an administrative nightmare for their seers . a fancy name they call their paper pushers . Because just as they define a power , it is not uncommon to have that power never reappear , so in the end , there was no point . The powers that have never reappeared are what we call god-tier , as they are often incredibly powerful or useful . There have been only 7 recorded , with only 1 currently still being active . It belonged to the man who was the head of the Ministry , a man called Reqrestrius John , an imposing man standing 7f 5 , and with the incredible power to cancel , as in cancel anything he wanted , all he had to do was touch it , and it would vanish . with this power , he had ended all adversaries in their stance , and had brought peace to our world .

It started at the absolute lowest point of my life . Actually , I think the day before the lowest , because the lowest was the next morning . On the day I tried to die , I was really depressed . Clinically depressed , it 's called . Every thought I had revolved around what a terrible person I was , how I deserved to die , how I wanted it to just end . I would think briefly how much happier people would be when I was gone , but I realise now that I actually barely thought about other people at all . I was basically mad with pain and not thinking straight , even if the pain was emotional rather than physical . So I jumped in front of a train . It was n't even a decision , not really .

I did n't know I was going to jump . I definitely did n't go there to jump . And then I lay there for a really long time , and the physical pain started , and you know what ? I felt a lot better . I really hurt , physically , all over . It made the endless thoughts finally shut up for a while . I was thinking this is it , I am dying . I could n't smell any blood , or really feel anything either , other than that I was hurt . I was just lying there while people moved around , cleared the platform , rolled the train forward .

All I could see was yellow blocks either side of my head , and this woman 's face , a paramedic , telling me I was going to be okay .

I talked about what had happened and after a couple of weeks I was let out to go into therapy , CBT . I ca n't remember what it stands for , but you think different about things and it helps put life in a different aspect , and it 's really good if you can keep going to it .

But he was really nice , and I just opened up about everything that was going on . Just talking about it , what was going on and why I kept trying to kill myself , it helped . Like , I realised it just was n't ever going to change . I realised that the only time I was actually properly happy was when I was getting things together for another attempt , because that was the only time I was really looking out for myself .", "It 's screwed up , but I felt terrible and I was just trying to feel better .

But you need to be really fit for those , and if I was motivated to get fit , well , I would n't be depressed , would I . But I did get a camera and start putting the videos on YouTube . I got in so much trouble for that .

But that was the first time I actually had something I wanted to really do , and it turns out it makes all the difference .", "I really got into the CBT , and tried different pills which were horrible , but I was warned they could be . I just kept trying new ones until I found one that worked and did n't make me fat or a zombie . Six months after getting onto sertraline I was getting my life back together . I stopped doing the videos , and people forgot really quickly that I even existed . I tried with the fire department and the army . That reporter was amazing , he knew all these people . He wanted to make a long feature out of it , but I think if he had n't cared at least a little he would n't have worked so hard to get me on the right path . And now I 've got a life . It pays fuck all , honestly , especially considering I 've already died three times , but I 've got a job , got a degree even , and I love what I do . Obviously I ca n't talk about it in any detail , but yeah , the Navy really came through for me . I think killing myself was the best thing I ever did .

So I kept the sugar and swapped out the cartoons . There was the same news team I always watched , spread out on couches to show how casual and friendly they were . They would laugh and joke . Apparently , behind the scenes , they all hated each other . That fact made the show almost worth watching . I had waited and waited for one of them to snap , live on camera . Instead , I had snapped . Where I had expected people on couches , I saw creatures . The sports guy was a horned and heavy bull like biped - a minotaur ? - and the lead female anchor was a mermaid , her scaly tail flopped in the cool dry studio air . Those are some good costumes . Why are n't they bringing them up ? They are *really* good costumes . These had been the thoughts that went through my head . When I had stepped outside to make my way to my office my neighbours had worn similar disguises as they drove off to work . I ran back inside . The mirror showed a confused human man . No animal parts . Then I went and saw Dr Bint .", "* * *   My time with the doctor had been unfruitful and so I had come back home and gone to bed . Despite how real the pillow beneath my head felt , I was adamant that this was all a dream . `` Just got to wake up . '' I said to myself , hands over my eyes `` That 's all . Just got to wake up . '' Someone knocked at my front door . `` Just got to wake up . '' They knocked again . I wiped the tears away and went to the door . As my hand gripped the handle I paused . `` Who is it ? '' `` It 's Carol , saw your car out front . '' Said a voice like Carol 's `` Figured we could grab a coffee and watch some 'toons if you 're not going to work . '' Carol is my neighbour from a few houses down . A friend . She is a young women that enjoys tattoos , skate-boarding , and cartoons - hobbies of which I could only relate to one . I opened the door and sighed with relief . I then sucked the sigh back in with a quiet gasp as she walked into my house . She had looked normal , and was - mostly . A faint and not unpleasant green coloured her skin and darkened in a few areas : her cheeks , her eyelids ...   Where tattoos had travelled up her arms there was vines , not made of ink , but real vines . A wreath of flowers adorned her head . She still wore a stretched and tattered T-shirt with the faded logo of some band , grubby blue jeans , and flat bottomed sneakers . I do n't know why I could tell her and not the Doc , but I did . * * *   `` That 's fucked up , Pauly . ''", "She said when I had finished describing what I had seen on the TV and at Malachi Bint 's medical practice . `` Wait ... ''   `` Yeah , I 'm crazy , right ? No one looks like themselves ! '' I said . I watched her face . Waited for her to scream or back away from the madman and find an excuse to leave . She just seemed confused . `` Wait ... ''   `` You can leave if you want . '' I said `` I think I 'll just check myself into a mental hosp- ''   `` Wait , wait , wait ! '' She had a smile on her face `` What am I ? Have I got bat wings ? '' `` Um , no . '' I said . `` Do I at least have a tail ? '' `` No . No tail '' She was going to hate what I saw . She would want to be something cool and instead she was some plant lady . `` Anything cool ? '' `` Well , um . '' She squinted , leaned forward and put a hand on my knee `` Paul , describe me . '' I did . `` What ? '' I described her again . `` That 's what I thought you said . '' She looked at me with a raised eyebrow . `` I do n't get to choose how I see people , sorry . '' `` Paul . '' `` Yeah ? '' `` That 's exactly how I look . '' I looked at her - green and beautiful and ... and ...   `` Fuckin what ? '' I said as what she said hit me . * * *   I dragged Carol with me into Dr Bint 's office as a bright winged fairy left .", "`` Paul , I- '' He started . I closed the door behind Carol and I , and said `` Doc , I need your help . '' `` Whatever you need , Paul . '' His voice was calm and caring and his eyes were on Carol `` And you are ? '' She put out a hand `` Carol , Carol Channing . '' The Satyr Dr Bint smiled and gave her offered hand a shake `` Any- ''   `` No , no relation '' Said Carol with a forced smile . I was giddy and smiling . It could n't be , could it ? `` Doc , describe her for me . '' `` What ? '' He said . `` Just do it , please . '' `` Well , um , she is a young women in her twenties who likes a band called , err , *Eedle Moth* ? '' She chuckled `` Needle Mouth , the shirts pretty faded . '' `` Ah , I see ! '' `` No , Doc , physically , describe her physically ! '' As I said this they both looked at me . He fiddled with his glasses and went red . `` I do n't think that that is appropriate , I hardly- ''   `` Just complection and the like , Doc . '' They looked at eachother and Carol shrugged . `` Well , she has healthy green skin ... ''   I fought back a cheer as the Doctor said it . *I 'm not crazy ! *   `` ... she has a lot of vine work on her arms , very good work by the way , talented artist . '' `` Yeah , I 've got a good guy . I 'm gon na get him to do flowers on my back . '' `` I always wanted a tattoo , '' The Doctor said with a chuckle `` Could never settle on a design , though . '' `` Carol , describe the Doc . '' `` Well I do n't think- '' The Doctor started , but Carol dove straight in . `` He 's got a kind , sweet look to him ; strong hairy legs , I 'd say his a runner ; he 's got a full head of hair , wo n't be going bald any time soon ; and has a ... *unique* choice of neck tie . '' She looked at me and smiled `` Do I pass ? '' I was lost in thought . Had been since she confirmed the Doc had goat legs . *What in the hell is going on ? *   `` Wait . '' I said aloud `` What do I look like ? '' `` You 've got healthy beige skin and hair in only a few places , why ? '' Said Dr Bint . *So , I still look how I thought I looked ... *   ***   I explained to the Doc what had brought me to him in the first place and then what had brought me back .", "He offered to check me in to the hospital , to have some scans , and I took it . They found nothing . I was healthy and , psychologically , was not a threat to anyone . After a few days I went home . I now spend my mornings before work trying to find others like me . Others that remember the way the world was . I 'm convinced that it has changed - or that I 've somehow travelled to an alternate reality . There 's got to be someone else . At least it gives me something to do in the mornings . Carol and I watch cartoons at night . -- -   *Edit : Came back to find that I had some gold .

I finally managed to open it and let out a satisfied `` Aha . `` , but instantly there was a loud pop and smoke began to pour out of the envelope . `` What the fuck !

'' I turned my head to the right , finding Eli sitting in a chair against the , facing me . He 'd swapped out the suit for a set of doctor 's scrubs , but he still wore the black sunglasses and expensive watch . `` What did you do to me ? '' I mumbled . Eli smiled . `` We made you better . '' `` Wha- what do you mean ? '' Eli stood up and held a barber style mirror in front of me . `` See for yourself . '' I looked at my reflection and gasped in shock . My eyes . They looked almost like camera lenses . Gray and metallic throughout , a shiny black dot at the center , as I looked at them I could see them dilate , the center ring visibly rotating . `` My eyes . '' I whispered , barely able to overcome the shock . `` And that 's just the tip of the iceberg . '' Eli said , putting down the mirror . `` Of course you probably wo n't notice the rest of your upgrades until you 're back on your feet . '' `` Why did you do this to me ? '' I asked , suddenly angry . `` Because , '' Eli said , taking off his glasses . `` We need more people like us .

'' here , a hand flitted across her chest and rested across her heart . She coughed violently , spasms rocking her thin body as another hand covered her mouth .

The familiar dull throbbing pain returned to her chest . Johannes offered her water , which she gratefully sipped . After a pause , she continued .", "`` We took a risk being here . They said we could n't find anything by the mines . But that ended up being our advantage . What was Sample 1215 ? '' Johannes could no longer contain his once cautious excitement . `` Sample 1215 was one of few organic compounds found from the soil dug up in the mines . There is life down there , likely bacterial in origin , and it is producing this compound in great quantities . Mass spec data revealed a unique peptide sequence found nowhere on Earth , though there is some homology to *Micromonospora* soil bacterial proteins , '' he paused to take a breath -- oxygen content is lower inside the Mars facility compared to Earth . `` When given to cancer cells *in vitro* , it killed nearly all of them while not harming non-cancerous cells .

The same cancer afflicting most of the population on Earth . The way you are now ... .There is n't much time . '' Edmunds nodded slowly in agreement .

Standing to his full height , he stumbles down the uneven cobbles as if unsure of his footing . ‘ ’ one more night of this and then I ’ m done ’ ’ he mutters to himself in a tired tone , he walks silently down the road , his presence only betrayed by the lopsided tapping of his cane on the cobbles . A damp smell lingers over Market street , the daytime scent of spices and fish brushed away by the night time breeze . Oil lamps long extinguished , nobody else dares travel the streets at night . The chalky gaze of the moon on the street reflected by the pooling water , shimmers against the cape of the man as he stalks . The cloaked figure draws closer to his destination , an inn called the travellers wagon . The warm glow from a fire seeps through a crack in the shutters , interrupted by the outline of a bolt from the inside . The cloaked figure finally draws to the inn , raises his cane and begins to loose shape once more .

The inside was grimy and the walls where filled with various mementoes from around the world , brought by traders who found themselves unable to pay for their drinks as they had yet to turn a profit in the London market ; Stags heads , exotic stuffed creatures and various antiques adorned the walls on uneven shelves , alongside artificial alchemist ’ s fire , left smouldering at night to guide any lingering drunks to their beds . An old wooden sign above the bar reads ‘ ’ free bear , tomorrow ’ ’ . ‘ ’ I ’ m telling you ’ ’ said Robert the innkeeper , a loud man with no care for personal space . Raising his left hand and pointing directly at a chess board in front of him , lifting his pint with the other . ‘ ’ you have to play offensively of you ’ ll get caught by the same old tricks every time ! ’ ’   ‘ ’ I have no time for a game like this ’ ’ announced Emmett , a young man who knew Robert far too well for his liking . Rising from his stool he set aside his empty glass and strode towards the bar . ‘ ’ If I could allow time to practice for games like these , maybe I could win ’ ’ he carefully set down his tabs worth behind the bar where the drunk innkeeper would see it and returned to the table . ‘ ’ let ’ s see if you can do any better. ’ ’ Adjusting his dull grey alchemist ’ s gloves and setting himself down to watch the game . The innkeeper stood over the table as if to make a plan , but before he could say anything , he was interrupted . A dark fog seeped under the door . The entire room seemed to change , as if the colour had been drained from the air , the gentle murmur of customers was silenced and replacing it was an eerie quiet . The fog rose to the height of a man and then condensed . ‘ ’ Robert Gus Clark ’ ’ said the now fully formed man in a heavy southern accent . He stood confidently , with stained white alchemist gloves and a matte cloak to contrast . His hair was a dull black and he had a knowing glint in his eye . He wore the recognisable attire of an imperial alchemist . The innkeeper knew all too well who he was . ‘ ’ Robert Gus Clark ’ ’ he repeated , this time louder . ‘ ’ y…yes ‘ ’ stammered the innkeeper . ‘ ’ you ’ re on my list ’ ’ said the man calmly . ‘ ’ b..bu ’ ’ the innkeeper stammered again , then suddenly understood . He turned on the spot , as if to make for an escape . Raising his arms to push his customers out of the way and reaching for his key chain . The alchemist smiled , then acted . He took one step forwards and lifted his cane , the glint in his eye grew and then faded . The innkeeper stopped , as if to freeze , he began to change colour , his expression faded and he began to lose shape . The once man started swirling on the spot and grew smaller , his feet lifting from the unwashed boards . Finally , he condensed into a small orb , pulsating from brown , to red and then back again . The whole event took only seconds , the onlookers stared on in stunned silence , as their good friend and innkeeper , Rob Clark , had disappeared . The cloaked man now stood taller , loosened his cloak and drew out a large bottle , he uncorked it and pointed it towards the floating orb . The nearby drinkers rapidly stepped back in unison as if the events had only just been played to them , nobody spoke out . The orb where Robert Clark had been standing began floating towards the bottle , condensed even further and was unceremoniously sucked inwards . The man corked the bottle once more and turned on the spot with military fashion , before unbolting the door and stepping outside . The door closed behind him as if any other customer was returning home , and the gentle glow of the fire returned to the room ."], "summaries": ["Under the midnight sky in London, a raven elegantly descends over the historic streets, blending into the shadows of Market Street.", "A mysterious cloaked figure transforms from a raven, navigating the deserted streets on a mission towards the Traveller's Wagon inn.", "In a quaint inn filled with curious mementos, a mysterious alchemist arrives to confront the innkeeper, ultimately causing a shocking disappearance and leaving the patrons in stunned silence."]}

What , are you scared ? '' I turned and glared at Steven , who 'd been taunting me all night . Really , all of my friends had been taunting me . Steven had his arm around a young girl , Cindy , with a swirl of blonde hair pinned loose in a bun and a flowing sundress covered in scattered , white polka-dots . Leaning against a stop sign was a taller boy , beat up hoodie and jeans with dark , brown hair and even darker brown eyes . He watched us with amusement , waiting for my answer as I stalled , pretending to look for something in my car . I felt a tug on the back of my coat and turned to see two beautiful brown eyes peering up at me . `` Do n't be a chicken , Ian , '' those eyes make my stomach flutter and her voice clears my head of any intelligent thoughts . I shut the door behind me and take in the girl before me , Lucy , honey-colored hair draped around her shoulders , and a loose-fitting sweater over tight jeans .", "We 'd been playing some kind of cat-and-muse game for a few weeks now and of course , Steven invited her along to try and bend me to his will in some way . Only now did I see in what way . `` I 'm really not sure I want to spend the night in the old abandoned hospital , '' I mutter , tearing my gaze from hers to look up the hill at the decrepit building . The guy at the stop sign , Jake , shifted his weight and walked over to the rest of the group , patting my shoulder . `` It 'll be fine , Ian . The place is huge and we can just explore it all night . '' I brushed his hand away and avoided Lucy 's eyes , turning back to glare at Steven . `` What 's in it for me , man ? This is such bullshit . '' `` Oh , I do n't know , man , '' Steven answered , nodding toward Lucy . She glanced back at him and he looked up into the sky , feigning innocence and even whistling for effect . Lucy shook her head with a smirk and her eyes locked with mine and I knew my answer as much as I hated to admit it .", "As we began to trudge up the hill , we were joined by Jake 's younger sister , Emily . She looked excited to be included and while Jake greeted her and Cindy and Lucy stopped to chat together , Steven jogged over to my side , staring at the twisted , iron gate . `` This 'll be great , dude . You can score a little action with Lucy , man . It 's perfect ! '' `` I would n't call an old , empty hospital *perfect , * Steve , '' I sighed and watched her for a second before turning to study the hospital again . `` I always figured we 'd go on a date before we started breaking into buildings to do it ... ''   `` Think of this as a date , Ian . I 'm sure there 'll be beds in here somewhere . Do n't be such a bitch , dude . Strap up , strap on , and let 's party . '' He laughed as Cindy approached him and wrapped an arm around her , pushing the gates open as I heard her asking what we 'd been talking about . `` Strap on ? What the ... ''   `` Strap on , huh ? '' I jumped as Lucy 's voice sounded behind me . `` What 's that mean ? '' `` Uh , nothing ! Something Steve said . '' I rubbed my neck , hot with embarrassment while Lucy 's eyes flashed in the moonlight and a smile played on her lips . `` Well , if that 's what he 's into , I guess . C'mon , let 's catch up . ''", "She dashed around me and squeezed through the gap between the gate and I noticed everyone had moved ahead while we 'd had our short exchange . I looked up at the gate before passing through . *The old Arkham Mental Hospital ... Closed down fifty years ago once they investigated the place for abuse of the patients . Who knows what we 'll find in-* A voice calling for me to hurry up interrupted my thought . `` What the hell ? '' I muttered before running to catch up to the group .", "Jake and Steven shoved into the front door , pushing all their weight to force it open as I arrived . The door ground against the floor of the foyer , sending a shower of dust into the air as it scraped against the tiles . We all squeezed through and Steven produced flashlights from a bag I had n't noticed him carrying . `` In case we decide to split up , we 'll each have a light . '' Steven passed them around and flicked his on , shining it under his chin to cast strange shadows over his face . `` Are we ready to descend into *unknown HORRORS BELOW ... '' * He spoke with an inflection like Dracula , throwing his voice around the halls around us in a gloomy echo . `` Let 's just move on , dork , '' Cindy teased , shoving him playfully . He chuckled and we began our trek , wandering the halls aimlessly . After checking a dozen rooms with no impressive findings , Cindy sighed . `` This is boring , '' she mumbled . `` Well , this place is abandoned . What did you expect ? '' Steven replied . `` I do n't know , something exciting , I guess . I heard there were like , tunnels connecting to the sewer in this place . '' `` Where the hell did you hear that Cind ? '' `` I do n't know . I heard some of them go straight to the bay . Why do n't we look for those ? '' She looked at Steven expectantly and he scanned the hallway before nodding . `` Ca n't hurt . How do we find these tunnels ? '' `` I do n't know . '' Cindy shined her light down the hall in both directions while Jake began flashing his into different rooms . `` Where did Emily go ? '' He asked . I looked around but there was no sign of her . `` What ? Where did she go ? '' I repeated Jake 's question . `` I bet she 's trying to scare us . '' `` Is n't that your job , Steve ? '' Cindy remarked , smirking at him . `` You 're right . Em , you 're not allowed to scare us ! '' Steve called , cupping his mouth with his hands . `` That 's my jo- '' A shrill scream interrupted him , freezing all of us in place .", "We shined our lights in unison down the hall toward the source of the scream . they all converged on a broken flashlight , smashed on the floor . Jake sprinted down the hall and we followed , Jake shouting Emily 's name . `` Jake , she 's probably just screwing with us , '' Steven said as we caught up to him . He was kneeling by the broken flashlight , staring at fresh blood stain spattered on the floor around the flashlight . We heard another scream cut short by a deafening *boom* and Jake bolted down the hall , screaming his sister 's name .", "I followed him and stopped short at the sound of commotion behind me . Steven was curled up on the floor , cradling his knee . `` I tripped . Do n't sweat it , just find Emily . '' His expression was contorted with pain but with Cindy at his side , I decided to grab Lucy 's hand and pull her along with me after Jake .", "I tried following his cries for Emily but eventually the echoes were playing with my ears as they rolled in from every direction . Lucy seemed turned around as well , spinning as she tried to discern where Jake might 've went . `` Did you see where he ran ? '' I asked . Lucy just shook her head , her eyes wide with fear . `` Maybe we should go back and get Steven ? ''", "Lucy was about to speak when we heard Jake 's voice again , this time clearly coming from down some stairs up ahead . I pointed the light down the stairs , the winding staircase walled with bricks as it headed underground . `` Maybe these lead to the tunnels Cindy was talking about ? '' Lucy said , tugging my sleeve . `` Maybe Emily went into the sewers . '' `` Went or was taken ? '' Lucy stared at me with a frightened look and I pt a hand on her shoulder . `` Sorry , I 'm just scared . Let 's go back and find Steve and Cindy . '' `` What about the stairs ? What if we get lost and ca n't find them again ? ''", "I studied the staircase for a second before taking my flashlight and placing it on the ground , pointing it the way we 'd come . `` There . When we see the light , we 'll know . '' `` I do n't know how I feel about that idea . '' Lucy handed me her flashlight and looked back down at the one I 'd placed on the floor . `` It 'll be fine , let 's just go . '' We retraced our footsteps back the way we 'd come , hoping we 'd remembered all those twists and turns .", "I was just beginning to think we were lost when I stepped on something round that nearly made me slip and fall . I pointed the light down to see Emily 's flashlight where we 'd left it . Steven and Cindy were nowhere to be found . `` Where are they ? '' Lucy demanded , the fear in her voice more than noticeable . `` Do n't freak out . Maybe they left to get help . C'mon , let 's see if they 're outside . '' We trudged back to the entrance , a straight shot down the hallway we 'd first come down . However , upon reaching the foyer , we hit a dead end on an empty wall . `` What the fuck ? '' I dragged the light over the wall 's surface , trying to locate the entrance . The wall was blank , no windows , doors , or paint . `` I do n't understand , this is where we came from . Where the hell did the door go ? '' I heard the sound of something rolling on the floor and turned to see another busted flashlight as it tapped my shoe .", "I pointed my light down the hallway and spotted a shape disappear around the corner where we 'd found Emily 's flashlight . `` Did you see that ? '' I demanded . `` See what ? '' Lucy cried , grasping my shirt . `` Fuck , I do n't know , '' my voice exposing my own fear . `` Let 's find a door . Okay ? '' I started walking along the wall , but the halls ended with rooms filled with broken cupboards and rotting tables . There were no other doors and I had n't remembered seeing another entrance when we 'd entered . With a sigh of resignation , I pointed the light back down the hallway , spotting nothing around the corner . `` We have to find Jake . '' `` What about Steve and Cindy ? '' `` Maybe they went after Jake and we missed 'em ... '' I was rubbing the stubble on my chin , sweat pouring down my neck when I remembered Cindy 's words .", "`` The sewers . We could find them and then get out through the sewers . '' `` What ? Why do n't we find an *actual* door or get out through a window ? '' `` I think all the windows are up on the higher floors , and none of these rooms go anywhere . We 'd have to go down that hallway anyways to keep searching . '' `` I guess ... '' Lucy followed me down the hallway , both of us huddled close together .

A year ago I decided to put in the paperwork and have the company participate in the Erasmus+ programme . I did this without proper permission . Even though I wasn ’ t given the red immediately , my red-green light soon turned yellow . The application was a rather struggle-free process and soon CVs were flowing in . For a while , I took it for what it was , my responsibility . It started by reading and responding to each and every CV , first in an engaging way and less along the way . In the beginning I had my “ rockstars ” separated from the rest of the children and different subs under my basic intern categories . It was a system with some level of complication , but not as complicated as some of the external factors weighing in . My anticipated results were dubbed by the Management as indifferent to our sense of urgency and unrealistic . The Management often accuses me of that . So unless you prove me otherwise , I am guilty as charged . My project was dead pretty much by the time I started bulking the incoming into lesser categories and more pages of uread mails . Then , one day , I felt my mailbox heavy , loaded with crap , so I deleted hundreds of Spam , and my ‘ INTERNS ’ mega-folder . I can ’ t remember when was this or how much time had passed up until your email , which I opened and scanned quickly – thought : maybe – responded professionally sending you the job ’ s description and that was it . Our communication began .", "You needed the credits , I needed the staff . My decision was based on my sense of urgency , which unlike what the Management likens to believe , derives from our collective sense of urgency . For a whole week I struggled with the idea and attempted to overcome this struggle by writing a letter to you . This letter was lingering in stchara @ gmail.com drafts from April 2nd ( on the day I was given your official notification of acceptance ) until April 9th when I deleted my convoluted , lectury , self-apprehensive Draft for a oneliner : “ Yes you may start and end your training a week earlier or later , just let me know what your travelling plan is once you know exactly. ”   This is what I told the Management in my quest for the Green Light : the language you speak and that we need you . That the programme will pay for everything , not one-cent needs to come out of our pocket if we don ’ t want it to . Yes , we have a responsibility to train her not teach her . There are no lessons loaded in exercises , all the learning is in the observation . But while I think such things now , during the first week of April I was going through some agony about your case . If you remember , I eventually talked about it with you , not to deprive you of expectations but things to anticipate . My guilt of all time has been that I should have given you the benefit of a doubt earlier on , before your official acceptance . Our brief break in communication between the end of March and beginnings of April – those 10 days – made me assume that we had more in-between time . The the job description would have been our kickstart for conversation , not the seal of approval . I know for a fact that this is not an interesting position and that no one , in our office at least , can teach you this as a career . There is no Wolf of Wallstreet roaming our office halls , just tumbleweed , silence and my dog . By the time we had our first Skype conversation it felt too late to mention broken machines and family rows , but I did it anyway and for some time it calmed me down . I ’ ve wonder if by resolving my worries I placed more burden on your shoulders . I ’ ve wondered if that Skype conversation should have happened first or at all . I ’ ve wondered if I ’ m emotionally or otherwise capable to handle a new co-worker/trainee . The first thing you will learn in our office is that “ No ” is the rightful answer to all questions . The next thing you will learn is that “ Yes ” is always the least affordable . Everything is situational , including ourselves and this relationship we are about to embark on . When I re-read your CV on April 2nd , I realised you were much more complex , beyond your language and your business degree , with publications on gender inequality in the labour market and state-led innovation systems . I saw in you my passion for education . I found an ally . That ’ s when accepting you became as much exciting as it was hard for me . Nothing could betray such doubts in my answer . Even if later on I exposed these thoughts to you , seeking to resolve my conscious inhibitions and to provide you with the right to an exit from a shithole , I did it because there was still time . Time is all there is , to say No and to say Yes , in everything . Here ’ s what ’ s funny .", "When I gave up on pursuing the Programme , the Programme didn ’ t know about it . When I decided to act on my pursuit , the Management didn ’ t know about it . Your letter of approval was as short as the time of discussion I had with others about it and so I went with it .

He placed his hand on my shoulder , and with the most earnest look in his eyes responded , “ Thank you so very much for the invitation . If it were any other night I would be delighted , but I am afraid I have a very pressing engagement I must attend to tonight. ” I must have looked disappointed because he quickly added , “ There ’ s a good chance I ’ ll stop by later though. ” I smiled , and it felt like the most genuine smile I ’ ve had since my son was born .

I ’ ve lived in the city a long time and I ’ ve never seen any wildlife aside from the occasional raccoon . “ Ah , my ride is here ” he said . We both chuckled as he collected his belongings . There wasn ’ t much , a blanket , the sign , and what looked like the remnants of a quart of milk . With hands all full he began to walk away , turning before he went . “ I wish you and your new family , Mary and Joey a very merry Christmas. ” I said it back to him quickly , with a smile and watched as he turned the corner towards the park .

I kept walking and thinking that perhaps I had , maybe I just forgot from it being such a surprise encounter . I made it home at a brisk pace and was happy to shake off my jacket , feel the warmth of being inside , and see the lights of the Christmas tree my wife decorated . When I heard her voice though I was filled with dread . “ Hi honey , welcome home ! ” She called from the kitchen . At that moment I realized I had forgotten the eggnog . The entire reason I had gone out of my way , and I had forgotten all about it . I pulled off my bag morosely and slid it to the ground . As it hit though , it made an odd noise . A sloshing hollow sort of noise . I opened it up to see what it was and found by some miracle a completely new very cold carton of eggnog . As I picked it up , I noticed a note had been placed upon it and in impeccable script was the message , “ Help for the helpless. ”"], "summaries": ["A man is irritated by a simple request for eggnog on Christmas Eve, feeling inconvenienced as he heads to the store in a part of town he dislikes, reflecting on his love for his family but disdain for the task.", "A chance encounter with a mysterious figure leads to a heartwarming revelation about the true meaning of Christmas.", "A kind encounter between a curious individual and a homeless person unfolds, leading to a heartwarming conversation about the value of human connection over material possessions.", "After impulsively inviting him over for dinner, she felt a genuine connection, but he had a pressing engagement.

They walk up to my cave , issue an *incredibly* poorly-worded challenge ( who is teaching these children to write ! ) and die without so much as denting a scale . It ’ s the same houses , the same family names . Their ancestry is writ on my walls in probably more careful detail than they themselves maintain in their own records . Some of these twits can barely lift a sword ! I mean - it ’ s a matter of respect . But anyway . The tournament .", "So at first I suspected another dragon had horned in on my territory . I took a solid year searching to the limits of my range , but not so much as a hatchling had invaded . After that , I thought maybe it was my own fault - had I finally killed off the best and brightest ? Had I so decimated the human population that this *was* the best I could come up with ? To my horror , I found that , no . There were still knights , just as many as there had always been . The little kingdoms that I terrorized were just as prolific and intelligent . They just no longer bothered to come after me . Instead , I got the rejects . The wanna-bes . The losers . The rest of the knights were playing *politics* , getting involved in wars and border disputes and righting wrongs and fulfilling ancient prophecies and - basically - not Dragon Slaying . For a while I just refused admittance to anyone that came up to my cave but that got boring . There ’ s only so many topics of conversation one can have with a gnome . I toyed with one-shotting them as they rode up the mountainside - a breath of fire out of nowhere - and it was fun for a while , but ultimately , unsatisfying . I thought about increasing my cattle-mutilation and maiden-kidnapping , but decided if it hadn ’ t been enough to attract the finest warriors before , it wasn ’ t likely to work… unless I went all-out . Of course I have human servants too .", "Through them I spent months working on my master plan . A Tournament . An inter-kingdom , prestigious tournament . Bags of gold and hands of fair maidens for the winners . It took several years to build up , but when it finally gained the size and recognition I wanted - it was glorious . Every single noble family for hundreds of miles attended . The festivities went on for a solid week . Every single king and his entourage was there . I actually started to take a lot of pride and interest in this little project - it was a fun diversion . Like building a sand castle before you stomp on it . And stomp I did .", "At the ten-year celebration . The final night ’ s awards ceremony . I was actually nervous , leading up to it . And then - oh , the glory . I timed my approach to appear over the horizon right at sunset , flying directly out of the sun . My first breath lit the treetops and flags - a precision shot . My second lit a ring of fire around the entire grounds - a circumference of miles . Of course , I left a little room to escape - no point in a grand showing if nobody ’ s around to tell the tale afterwards . In face , I specifically singled out every bard , storyteller , and entertainer so that they remained as undamaged as I could manage . Oh , how they screamed . For the first time in so many years , I had their undivided attention . Of course they didn ’ t fight me there . Airborne , a surprise attack , their tournament grounds , tents , and buildings burning around them ? They ran , and died . I boiled them alive in their armor . I bit them in half . I festooned horse entrails from the flagpoles . I even seized an honest-to-god princess to take back with me , right out of her father ’ s protective arms .", "And then I waited . With the hoard gleaming , the princess caged , their lands burning and desecrated , I waited . And do you know what they did ? NOTHING . THAT IS WHAT THEY DID . For a solid month . Not one knight . Not one attack . Not even a strongly-worded note . I finally couldn ’ t stand it any longer , and one night , let the princess out of the cage to talk .", "Why ? I demanded . She explained that dragon-slaying , which was an erroneous term as nobody had ever actually *slain* me was outdated . The kingdoms had learned to account for the loss of their cattle and fields occasionally and factored that into their economic plans . The extreme patriarchy decided that knights were far less expendable than maidens , and since I only took unmarried virgins ( STANDARDS ) , the easiest way to avoid losing daughters was to marry them off as fast as possible . They actually liked having me around ! I drove off other dragons and even kept large predators out of my range . It was something of an honor to have your possessions looted for my hoard ; some noble families kept track of how often I “ visited ” them and used it at a status symbol ! One of the kingdoms had declared my cavern and hoard a “ historical treasure ” . They felt I did them a favor by eliminating knights too stupid or short-sighted to try to fight me . I was an asset to the kingdoms . I was an icon . I was practically a god . How ? I asked her . I eat you . I kill your children . I kidnap your sisters and daughters . I burned you ! But you ’ re a good person , she said sincerely . You spare the poor and hungry . You kill the rich and mean . You never unfairly burden anyone . The tournament - they 'd figured out I hosted it each year - it was so unexpected . She was confused , and thought maybe I was n't feeling well or they 'd upset me somehow , and she was sure her father was confused , but nobody was going to come rescue her because she was sure that I was just going to let her go . I didn ’ t . I fried her to a fine crisp and snacked on princess jerky for the rest of the night .", "But it got me thinking - and I finally hit on my mistake . *That fucking farmer* . So I think I ’ ve decided it ’ s time to move on . I ’ ll get rid of the hoard - probably give it away , I ’ m too fond of it to burn it . I ’ ve heard there ’ s an island off the coast that ’ s never even seen a dragon before . Some seaside living might just be the change I need . I mean - there ’ s no point in staying someplace where nobody *appreciates* you ."], "summaries": ["A dragon reflects on hosting a tournament to attract brave knights for combat, emphasizing the value of noble battle and honoring defeated foes in a well-maintained hoard.", "The protagonist encounters arrogant individuals but shows mercy to those coerced by powerful figures, except for one vassal who incites their wrath by threatening a farmer's family, leading to a fiery retaliation.", "The narrator is an evil being who is skilled at being evil, but is finding it increasingly easy to defeat the challengers who come to stop them in a poorly organized tournament.", "A dragon realizes that the knights coming after him are not the best warriors anymore and contemplates new ways to attract worthy adversaries while reflecting on the decline in human valor and knightly pursuits.", "A master plan involving a prestigious inter-kingdom tournament comes to fruition, attracting nobles and kings before an unexpected twist unfolds.", "At the ten-year celebration on the final night, the protagonist orchestrates a spectacular and destructive display of power, causing chaos and capturing a princess in the midst of it all.", "A vigilant guardian waits in frustration as their plea for help goes unanswered, ultimately taking matters into their own hands by releasing the captive princess for a conversation.", "A misunderstood dragon thrives within a kingdom that considers it an asset for its unique functions, yet ultimately reveals a darker side by consuming a princess who believed in its goodness.", "After realizing a mistake involving a farmer, the character plans to give away their hoard and start anew on an island without dragons."]}

Why would who he loves change the fact that he loves him ? The hug after that . That 's what got him . The pain he felt when his second love broke up with him . The pain of exams . The pain of having to work so hard . Times where all he 'd wanted to do was go down on his knees , and beg for it to be over . `` It 's like breaking a bone , but in your thoughts . Y'know , there are millions and billions and trillions of stars , and I was down there , fussing over scars . It was ... Exhilarating . '' `` Right . ''", "The other is staring at him confused .

He 'd been upset when his dog had died . But this ? It came close to nothing else . He 'd cried so much . He 'd knelt down , hugged the tombstone and begged for the pain to be over . Begged for his daddy back . It was so unfair . He 'd been only seventy-five . He screamed , so , so , so loudly . His body , not just sad , but desperate . He did n't know what to do . He 'd felt trapped , weighed upon by expectations and needs and wants . He just wanted his daddy back . `` But- but there was a lot of good too . ''", "`` Yeah ?

His first kiss , with the man who would be his husband . The kiss at their wedding . Laughing and being stupid with his friends , all through his life . The birth of his first son . And then his second . And then his third . Seeing them graduate , and learn , and grow . Seeing them have babies of their own . The sex with his husband , god that 'd be a highlight .

I've be here since I was 7 weeks old, but it's still been hard being the only rich kid in a 3 hour time zone. I was used to people using me for the £6.1 million family inheritance me, my 28 year old sister, 17 year old sister and 8 year old brother all share. As I explained beforehand, There was only one high school in a 3 hour time zone so it wasn't unusual for new students to start every week. But not one ever wanted to be friends with me until they found out I was only a millionaire. I was always the type of kid who kept to themselves and didn't have many friends, who didn't pretend to be my friend for the use of the family inheritance.

I told him I couldn't take being used for back-up anymore and said we couldn't be friends no longer. It wasn't his emotional reaction which bothered me as much as his body language did, when ever he was near me he was fidgeting constantly and progressively, I being more and more drawn me into him.

I tried to speak. \"oh yes... silly me I forgot you can't speak can you \" a surprised look appeared on my face as I thought \"what an earth is this psycho saying\".

That's the venom coursing through your veins, as it finds its way to your pure innocent heart. Then, poor old ruby, you can be a blood sucking demon just like me.\" my heart began to stop, my veins started to burst out from underneath my burning skin as my brain shut down slowly.

She left her multi-billion-dollar company in the middle of a staff meeting when her assistant gave the message. At the other end of the line, she was neither shocked nor surprised by the news. Actually, she expected it. She called her driver and told him to start the limousine. She pulled out her mirrored compact to make sure she covered the Frankenstein monster scar above her right eye. It was both a reminder and a symbol of what she had gone through in her life. She still wanted to look presentable, but she still had to hide it with the bangs. As she left in a hurry, she told her secretary she would be gone for the remainder of the day. She didn’t tell anyone where she would be going. This was something she had to do alone. If they knew—her staff, the ones she cared about—would they understand? “Probably not,” she thought. “What would they do?", "Feel sorry for me?” \n            She entered her private elevator with her personal elevator clerk, Jasper. He was a comely, greying black man with glasses wearing his red and gold blazer, the company’s colors, with black pants with a gold stripe down his side. “Going down, Mrs. George?” He exclaimed. “Yes, Jasper!” she said. Not another word. As the elevator reached the ground of the dark, closed-off garage, her driver, Francis, an Irishman with a perennial red face and stout belly protruding through a blazer, a black chauffer’s cap covering what was left of his hair was there to meet her. “Are we going to the airport, Mrs. G?” he asked. “Yes,” she said. “O’Hare and not a moment too soon.”\n             When Francis arrived at O’Hare, he parked in front of the Eastern Airline terminal. “Here we are, Miss!” he said.", "“Well, you know I’m not taking Eastern, Francis!” she stated. “Oh, that’s right!” said Francis. “Someone will be meeting you here!”\n            As soon as she spoke, the man she told her secretary to call was meeting her in front of the limousine. Jenny pushed the window button to open it. In front of her was an eager young man opening the door. “Mrs. George,” he exclaimed. “My name is Kenneth Morgan and I will be accompanying you to the jet.” Kenneth seemed like a willing participant. “Thank you for coming with me,” Jenny said. “It’s been a while since I’ve gone private.” \n            “It’s not too far a walk,” he stated. Before she left, she told Francis that she should be back by 10 o’clock this evening. It wasn’t a trip. It was something she had to do. “No problem,” he exclaimed in his flat Chicago accent. “Take care, Mrs. G.!”\n            As she and Kenneth passed by porters, families waiting to board, and stewardesses in their military-inspired uniforms, complete with hats and high heels scurried along, Jenny felt fortunate that she did not have to stay with the so-called great unwashed masses. Her flight was at another part of the airport. Before she knew it, Kenneth had led her to a corridor with an electronic door. When it opened, she saw the Cessna jet with her company’s insignia on the side. When the door opened, her personal stewardess, Pamela, greeted her. “Is this a business trip or a pleasure one, Mrs. G.?”\n            “You know it’s neither, Pammy!” she said as she walked up the stairs. Once she got in and removed her fur, she heard the pilot tell her, “We’re about to take off, Mrs. George!” \n            “Thank you, Stan!” she told her pilot.", "Her Cessna jet was neither small nor large. It was the middle plane in her fleet. The one to take her from Chicago to New York without any muss nor fuss. As Pamela brought her favorite beverage, Jenny was not in the mood for drinks. She rehearsed over and over again what she was going to say. She had been waiting so long to say it. Now she had every word memorized in her head as if she was giving a speech to the board of directors or to her many employees during the company’s holiday party. She was ready. “Just get me there in one piece.” She said to herself. “I must get there!”\n            She couldn’t bring herself to take a nap. She was too keyed up. Besides, the trip was only 90 minutes long and sleep was non-negotiable. “We’re getting set to land, Mrs. George!” said Stan over the plane’s intercom system. “Thank goodness!” she whispered. When the plane landed at LaGuardia Airport, Jenny gather her fur and her purse, and said to Pam that she would see her in a couple of hours at the most, and to sit back and relax.", "Pamela smiled as she watched Jenny disembark from the jet. There to meet her was Ann Fineman, her New York office representative. “Good afternoon, Mrs. George! How was your flight?” she asked. “Smooth, I guess. I truly wasn’t paying attention!”\n            She was right. Jenny was not paying attention. It was all about the visit. “Your limo is this way,” said Ann. Jenny took a deep breath as she entered the limousine door opened. “Another Lincoln,” she muttered. Whatever. She sat in the car with Ann and did not hear what her New York limousine driver said to her. Did he say, “Hello, Mrs. George”? Jenny really didn’t care. She was back in her hometown. The city where she was born. The city that she departed in disgrace nearly 30 years ago. As the limousine left LaGuardia from the runway, she realized her trips to her New York office were to her Manhattan office. She didn’t go to her true birthplace: Brooklyn. This would be the first time she has returned to Brooklyn since, well...\n            Jenny sat back and began to reminisce. She remembered the streets she would pass: the ice cream shop, the Woolworths, the Jewish delicatessen where she bout the hot dogs she loved over Nathan’s or the hot dog stands at the corner.", "She saw that the neighborhood had changed. There were still a lot of the ethnics: Jews, Irish, her fellow Italians. But the neighborhood was changing colors. It was browner and blacker. But unlike Chicago, they seem to be able to live together. Or so she thought. Her mind began to wander again. This time about what she’ll say when she gets there. They will be waiting. All of them. All five of them. They were older, prettier, and personable. In her own mind, they were beautiful with curves and breasts, pert noses, and shiny hair. The olive-colored skin tone made her pale one look as though she were adopted. Jenny was tall, big-boned, and flat-chested. She wasn’t them. She didn’t look like them. But in the long run, she was better than them in her own mind. I cannot wait for them to see me. They know about me. They know about my struggles. The limousine stopped right in front of the hospital. “Here we are, Mrs. George!” her driver exclaimed. Jenny pulled out her compact and opened it. Powdered her nose to take the shine off. Her powder is world-renowned for taking off the oils and leaving a “diamond finish”. She wants to glow for those to see her. As her driver stopped the car and opened his door, he walked around the back and opened the door. He was young, pale-faced but cheerful. He held his hand out to help her out. She obliged, stretching her right hand out as she disembarked from the car. She felt her black patent leather high heels fall onto the pavement. As she stretched her long limbs out of the car, she decided not to bring her fur but her purse was coming with her. It had to. There was something in it. When she walked through the automatic doors, Jenny could smell it.", "The aroma of a hospital. She was familiar with it. Her time in one was one she wouldn’t forget. The bandages, the casts, the feeling of incapability and of helplessness. Never mind, she said. It’s time to move on. She walked to the reception desk and noticed a few people, women, in particular, staring at her. Maybe they have seen my commercials, she thought. Or perhaps they saw the interview she did on the Today Show or the cover of Time magazine. But they did look and stare. Even the receptionist looked at her as if she were Elizabeth Taylor or Jackie Onassis. “Valentina Giordano’s room?” Jenny asked. “Are you a relative?” the receptionist asked. “Yes!”\n            “Fourth floor ICU, room 409,” said the receptionist as she gave Jenny her pass. “The elevators are on the right.”\n“Thank you!” Jenny said as she walked towards the elevator. As she pushed the up button, she waited patiently as she saw a young couple down the corridor.", "It brought back memories for Jenny, both good and bad. The good also meant the bad. The bad was just the horror of losing and losing. But this was erased from her mind. The elevator had arrived. She got on with a doctor in scrubs and a delivery man with a bouquet of flowers. The doctor was going to the fifth floor. The flower man asked Jenny to please press button number four. The elevator door closed and lifted up to the scheduled destinations. Jenny didn’t have time to think as the elevator didn’t make any stops until the fourth floor’s bell rang. The door opened. She stepped out first, followed by the flower guy. They both reached the fourth floor’s nursing station. The head nurse told the flower man that the patient couldn’t receive flowers and politely sent him back to the elevator. Jenny shook her head. “That’s quite unfair!” she thought to herself. A waste of money for someone who would never see the flowers. Anyhow, she asked the head nurse where Valentina Giordano’s room was. The nurse was taken aback when she saw who she was talking to. “Her room is four doors down, but there are many people there,” she told her. “Fine,” said Jenny. “I’ll clear the room.”\n“By the way,” Jenny stated. “How is she?”\n“It’s just a matter of time,” the nurse, a slight Filipina said with a gap-toothed look and a slight accent. “Her parish priest came to give her last rites.”\n“It’s near the end,” said Jenny. “Thank you!”\nAs Jenny left the nursing station, she walked quickly to the room. As she entered, she saw them.", "They were there. “The Big Five” And how “big” they have gotten in addition to being old, matronly, and portly. The voluptuousness had been replaced by rolls of adipose tissue. Their hair went from salt and pepper to fully grey. But there they were: “Little Val”, the eldest, followed by Maria, Paola, Angelina, and Ciara. The prettiness that at one time been beautiful had become settled like day-old Jell-O. Their husbands were there too. They were the ones who tried to pawn her off to their buddies to date her, which only led to disaster. They were also old, grey, paunchy, and in a couple of cases, bald. Their children and a sprinkling of grandchildren were there as well, at least the older ones, the granddaughters looking like younger versions of their nonnies. When Jenny confidently walked into the room, she saw who she had come to see. She was lying in bed, old frail, stick-thin to the extent that she resembled a loose branch that was about to fall from a tree. Her hair was long and grey and had dark circles around her withered face. Despite her prune-like demeanor, she was still the woman who treated her and berated her. What was shocking was the reaction by Little Val, who was bigger than she was when Jenny left Brooklyn, or the word she loved to tell her newfound friends, “banished”. “Who are you and what are you doing here?” she said. But Maria, the other former beauty, sat up and said to Little Val, “Val, do you know who this is?”\nBefore another word was said, the three other sisters and their spouses got up from the chairs they were sitting at by Valentina’s bed. They came close to Jenny and each gave her a hug and a peck on the cheek. Little Val said, “I’m sorry, Jenny. I didn’t recognize you at first,” as she walked over and held both her hands. The brothers-in-law followed with hugs but Jenny pulled away from Maria’s husband, Marco, who she never liked nor trusted, and stretched out her arm for a handshake. “It’s nice to see you all,” exclaimed Jenny, even if she truly didn’t mean it. “But I would like some time with her along. So please leave me until I’m ready to go. I won’t be long.”\nThe room obliged as they all slowly and quietly left. As they were leaving, Christina, Paola’s teenage granddaughter turned around and quietly said to Jenny, “I use all of your products. They’re great!” \n“Thank you!” Jenny told her and kissed her forehead. When they left, Jenny closed the door. The machines attached to Valentina were doing double work.", "Valentina was going in and out of consciousness. When she did open her eyes, with the tubes in her nostrils, she saw someone. Jenny looked foggy in her eyes and was unsure who it was. “Who are you?” she said in a labored voice. “Do I know you? Where is everyone?”\nJenny brought her chair closer to Valentina, picked up her thin, veiny IV line-injected hand, and began to speak. “Buona sera, mama!” she said. “It’s me, your youngest daughter, Annamaria, you know the one everyone calls Jenny.”\n“J-J-Jenny?” Valentina stuttered. “Oh, my God!”\n“Hush, mama,” Jenny said as she readied herself for this moment, for this speech, a speech she had been waiting to tell her most of her life. “Let me say, first of all, that your youngest daughter, me, the one you said was ugly, the one you said had a big nose and big teeth the size of Sicily. The daughter you said would never become anything. The daughter you sent to business school to become a bookkeeper because you didn’t think anyone would marry her so she had to work in the bowels of a bank. The daughter you tried to pawn off to Guido Cartelli, the son of a made-man with fat sausage fingers whom she wouldn’t go all the way with. The daughter you sent off to Steubenville, Ohio to live with your childless, widowed sister, where she found a job and a man with hair so blond and eyes so blue, he was movie-star handsome who pretended to be an adult but was actually a seventeen-year-old boy. The daughter who would have his baby and lied to him about my pregnancy so I wouldn’t marry him. The daughter who left Ohio for southern Illinois and had a beautiful blond baby daughter in a rooming house on a snowy New Year’s Eve when I couldn’t make it to a hospital. The daughter who gave up her baby so she could have a life instead of being raised as an illegitimate child. The daughter worked for a widowed, charismatic lawyer named Robert George and married him. The daughter became pregnant again and then lost that baby and her husband in a horrific car accident that broke her limbs and disfigured her face. The daughter whose face was remade into the beauty you always wanted her to be but lost her husband and unborn child. The daughter whose late husband left money to start a business combining extra virgin olive oil and aloe Vera and started one of the most successful companies found and run by a woman. The daughter is one of the most successful and admired women in the world. Yes, the daughter has a scar over her right eye from the accident. But that scar is a battle scar. That scar reminds her every day about both better and worse and rich and worse and rich and poor. Yes, mama, I was able to say those vows and do EVERYTHING you told me I couldn’t do. “So, mama, as you are on your death bed, breathing your last breath, struggling to stay alive, I wanted the last face you will see before you go is mine. My brand, new face with a new nose. This better than ever face you always wanted for me. This new face both you and papa wanted but were always browbeating me over. Now as you join Papa, I want to thank you for telling me I was ugly and no good and too skinny for ANYONE to love or admire me. I used your disgust to inspire me. It took a while, but I made it. And for this, I say, ciao, Mama!”\nAs Jenny rose from her chair, Valentina’s monitors started to go off. Valentina tried to reach for Jenny’s arm, but Jenny had turned her back to her as she left the room. When the door opened, Jenny’s sisters heard the alarms as the doctors and nurses ran toward them. Before Giada went into the room, Jenny stopped her, reached into her purse, and gave a blank check with her signature on it. “It’s my contribution for her funeral costs,” she told the grey-haired pudgy one. “Don’t go over $20,000 or I will sue you.” She put the folded check in her fleshy palm and walked down the corridor. As the elevator door opened, going to the main floor, Jenny stepped in. As she entered, her grand-niece Christina caught the door before it closed. “You’re a good woman, Jenny George!” she said. Jenny smiled and said, “I know” as the door closed on both of them."], "summaries": ["Jenny, a successful businesswoman with a mysterious scar, receives a call in October 1973 that prompts her to abruptly leave her company and embark on a solo journey of unknown purpose and significance.", "A mysterious woman named Mrs. George, accompanied by her enigmatic employees, Jasper and Francis, heads to the airport in a hurry.", "Jenny boards a private jet accompanied by Kenneth and her stewardess, Pamela, for a mysterious trip.

Zane is single-handedly the reason I was able to get through the period of self-loathing I was in, for he stayed when no one else did. He listened. It was entirely unfamiliar to have someone to talk to, someone whom around, I was able to let down the walls guarding my heart.", "Of course, I am partly the reason I began to heal emotionally as well, for I did take that step to grow; however, it remains as clear as the sun on a peaceful afternoon that I never would have taken said step without his words of encouragement. He quite literally saved me, so why can I not thank him? Internally, I could not be more grateful for this man, yet I have a lousy way of portraying my gratitude. While self-aware that I am hurting him by denying my feelings, I am unable to change. Perhaps it’s my pride that is holding me back, or maybe it is the fear of not being everything he deserves. Whatever the reason may be, the effect of my denial has taken a toll on him, whether he chooses to admit it or not.

He loves me, everyone knows it at this point, and I love him too. No, I’m in love with him. I love him more than any combination of letters could ever begin to describe, and if I could just tell him. If I could tell him that while I do hate most people, I don’t hate him. I never have hated him, even from our first meeting, it frightened me that I did not feel repulsed by him. As a matter of fact, I felt drawn to him. Admitting this to myself is already more than I ever could have imagined doing a few months ago, but here I am, practically confessing my love and gratitude for him in the comfort of my own mind. The comfort of my own mind. That sentence alone frightens me considering my mind has always been the least comforting place for me, a place where I felt trapped, undeserving, and unloved. A place that used to bring me nothing short of torture but now brings peace thanks to Zane.

If I hold off any longer, it may very well never be the right time again.

When my own family left and the people I looked up to most turned on me, you reminded me I deserve better time and time again.

Pakistan hired Boeing’s from England,they took the responsibility to trained or streamline the crew.In those days,Airlines services were very few in Asia,I think Japan and India had introduced it already,The air traveling was expensive and many people they were afraid of traveling in air .So,Pakistan was also newly emerged country,despite of limited resources,they go ahead with the Airlines services,which was considered,in those days, as luxurious and expensive. Airline experienced many issues line by line.First issue gruelled in front of us,was uniform for the Hostesses.Momy Jan,threw an idea of “Shilwar Qameez\"for hostesses,instead of skirt .The idea liked by our Managing Director.”Green shirt and white Salwar ,with a cute girlish cap had it’s amazing impact.To speed up the bussiness,every body knows,advertising is the back bone.Momy Jan,consented for the appearance in advertising for the Airlines.In Karachi,Lahore ,till Peshawar ,Bill boards were displayed,with the appearance of Momy Jan gesture with the slogan\"Great people Fly with PIA\".Momy Jan,became a star Model,instead of her rising nature as an attended. There was always a sweet smile on her lips.Karachi,in those days and till now,considered  a business hub,the whole economy of the country ruled through this great city,rich businessmen,bureaucracy were eager to glimpse Momy.Here I’m witness,in so many gatherings and Government official function ,she received standing ovation.This I never experienced before and till date.All the important flights,carrying president were designited to her.I still remember,First lady of America,Jackie Kennedy praised the hospitality of Pakistan International Airlines and she very boldly highlighted the glimpse of Momy Jan,now she was a world fame hostess.In Karachi,in the beginning of the cricket test matches,they spread rumors that Momy Jan also coming to see the Cricket Test Match.Folks were also lovers of Cricket ,Television was not introduced yet,the only living entertainment in Pakistan was cricket and Films.Once we both recon Alfenson street to have Juice.The Juice serving boy ,started fastly naming the famous juice brands and one of the famous juice brand they named”Momy Large Juice”.we were sipping the Momy Large Juice,in the meantime,Some body yelled “Momy Jan here” and in little time hundred of people gathered there,the shopkeeper begin with the photo session and next day our pics appeared on the newspapers.Despite of her glamoroued life,she was very simple and straight forward as before.Once in our projection Room,a short film of a plane crashed displayed.Nearly all the crew was present in the hall.The purpose of the film was to highlight the causes of ditching and to discuss it.When we came to room,Momy became overtly perturbed and said “Sheema,before our death we would informed each other and if not after the death we would informed each other.”I looked towards Momy and said”Don’t talk foolish,how it could be possible to informed each other like this”.We both laughed.In September,1964,we headed to a popular lady palmist,Mrs Chestnut Hill.She was popular for taking glimpses on a Match box,her predictions caused hundred percent accurate,she got available only on appointment.", "She examined me very smoothly, enriched me with her advices but

It's time.\" The pale light of morning peered in through the slit doorway of his canvas tent. As was always the case, the sharp bar of burning radiance managed to find its way into his eyes. Thaddeus blocked it out with his puce-skinned arm and proffered a sigh of irritation. Though truth be told, he was relieved, waking to that sight. After so many long months of being trapped beneath the surface, traversing the Harrowhearth, being free, seeing the sunlight again, it felt like a dream come true. He scratched tiredly at his wrists, where rings of draconic scales had already formed, digging into his skin while they aligned. With a growl, he stood and willed them away. Now was not the time to be shifting. He was free of the stresses of the Harrowhearth; he could see the sun! Though he was far from home and wasn't even sure if his family was alive or not, he'd have the chance to find out something he couldn't have said for sure even the night before. His campmates had left him an ivory comb, which he attempted to use to turn his hair into something less than a snarled mess to no avail.", "Thatch planned to ask Priam and Michrath for the location of the nearest river, where he could cleanse the grime from his skin and the muck from his hair. But nothing will ever wash away the blood. So much blood spilled beneath the earth. Suddenly, images flashed through his head of Sarauthedes, one of the women he'd been traveling alongside before...no; he vowed not to think about it. They'd met for the first time in the prison beside the arena in which they were forced to fight. Still clad in a torn white blouse and skirt, she'd looked so sweet and fragile. Even more so as, time and time again, she'd been thrown into the pit, and time and time again, she'd returned, drenched in her own gore. Oh, so much blood. During the penultimate battle before being sold to a fresh hell, she'd been felled again. Thatch had carried her twitching body out of the pit, heedless of the audience's screams. They'd wanted to watch her die, but he wouldn't give them that pleasure. He'd torn apart her skirt for thread and used the rat bone he'd been chewing on to sew up her wounds. His support had helped her push through. Thaddeus Thimblevinter had protected her. Until I didn't. Unable to deny the flooding memories or the tears that came with them and hating himself for it, Thatch could feel the dragon starting to take over. On his forearms, skin hardened into scales, and fingernails lengthened into ripping claws. He'd use those claws to tear apart the cloth prison, which denied him the ability to vent his hollowing rage to the sky above. \"Thaddeus, are you coming?\" Another voice came from without. It sounded like Michrath, but the weredrake couldn't be sure. He hadn't even known the two men for a full day yet. \"Our window of opportunity is slipping away by the minute. If you'd like to be present, you'd best hurry.\" Thatch still didn't know what the two men were inviting him along for. They'd kept him entirely in the dark. Ironic, since one of them's a priest of light and all. Michrath was a cleric from the same holy conglomerate Sarauthedes had represented. Either way, Thatch supposed it didn't matter what was going on. He was being given a chance to walk on the surface world again, let the sweet aromas of nature soothe his mind. These men had trusted him, despite being given little reason to, and it wouldn't be right to repay that hospitality by ripping their tent to shreds in a grief driven blood-rage. The were-drake tamped down his rage and his shifting potential and strode from the tent.", "After so many months in the unchanging warmth underground, it was surprisingly chilly. It might take some time to get used to the air of late spring, which had once been so commonplace to him, but Thatch figured he could surpass that minor obstacle. Anything had to be easier to get over than the trauma he'd experienced in the Harrowhearth. :That place is where you belong. You are a weredrake now; a creature made for lurking through deep tunnels in ravenous madness, not skipping through grassy meadows full of falling flower petals. : The damnable sentience stuck in Thaddeus's head had a penchant for ruining any good mood he conjured up. \"Shut it, Khrysalto,\" he growled warningly. \"You're out of your element, your place of power. I'm home and in control, and there's nothing you can do about it.\" :Just like you could do nothing about saving sweet Sarauthedes,: the voice said smugly. Thatch could almost hear the sneer. Oh, how he wished he could punch this creature in the mouth. But unfortunately, Khrysalto was nothing but a disembodied voice in Thatch's head, so he was plum out of luck in that regard. The best the Khindre could do was try to tune him out. :Did I not say? She would be the first to die. If you'd only taken my advice, she could have had a shred of mercy. And you call me evil! :\nPriam and Michrath were already waiting in the carriage when Thaddeus arrived and no sooner had he leaped into the back than the tall, half-elven priest had flicked the reins, setting the cart into motion.", "Sitting beside the surly blonde fellow did not make for a comfortable ride. It feels like he's judging me; as if he blames me for...what? Was it something I said? Of course, it was. Thatch had told him that Sarauthedes was dead. He didn't know who this Priam thought he was; Sarauthedes hadn't mentioned anyone like him during their talks. I knew about Michrath. Sarauthedes said he was her very best friend. That was why the Khindre had chosen to trust them beyond using them as a method of escaping the Harrowhearth. That was why he'd answered their questions, spilled the truth about Sarauthedes. And now... What were they playing at? Less than an hour later, he knew, as the carriage stopped in a meadow. The vibrant greens and various popping hues of the grass and wildflowers seemed muted now, despite their desperately missed beauty. Silently, their faces rigid-set and dour, Priam and Michrath unloaded a box from the carriage. They set it down and began to remove things from it, various bowls, strands of flowers, vials full of water. Seeing that water, which had been such a scarce resource, that whenever the group had come upon some, they had to choose who got the privilege of drinking, Thatch realized just how thirsty he was. Quietly, trying to be unobtrusive, the Khindre sidled over and reached for a vial sitting off to the side. His untrimmed fingernails clinked on the glass, and Priam whirled around, fire in his eyes. \"If you were considering drinking that, I'd advise you to consider again.\" \"What's in there?\" \"Holy water. As a tainted were-creature, it might harm you. Besides, we're going to need every last drop. Or don't you want to see this ritual work? You were the only one of your companions who stayed, after all. Thatch flared up in return. \"I don't even know what the ritual is! How can I answer that question without that vital piece of information?\" \"We told you, your whole bedraggled lot before the others went off on their lonesome. We're going to bring Sarauthedes back!\" \"Wha_?\" But Priam just kicked the crate and stormed off. Michrath glanced apologetically at Thaddeus and shrugged, though the Khindre could see the tightness in his muscles, too.", "\"He's not normally like this, I promise. He's just stressed, is all.\" \"And I'm not?\" Thaddeus thundered. \"He's not the one who had to struggle day in and day out for survival! He didn't have to live life always looking behind him, fearing that the slavers would be there ready to take him back to days of constant torture! He didn't have... he didn't have to watch Sarauthedes die!\" Hot, angry tears were flowing freely down his face now. Michrath put down the ritual tablet he was preparing and walked over, placing a surprisingly strong hand on Thaddeus's shoulder. \"She meant a great deal to you, I imagine. You don't know him, so I can't blame you, but you have to think that he cares about her too,\" the half-elf explained sagely. He sounded like a wise Abbott passing his teachings down to his pupils, even though he didn't look much older than his mid-twenties. \"His feelings are sincere. What I'm about to say might not make a lot of sense. But, seeing her perish, as much as I'm sure it hurts, that just might make you the lucky one, in his eyes. I know, I told you it'd sound crazy. Think of it this way. You met her, became close to her, and then lost her, watched the light fade from her eyes. Priam met her, became close to her, and then said farewell, with hopes and plans to meet again. Then, he comes to see her and gets the rude awakening that she's missing. Naught more than a week later, we rescue you in hopes of pulling her out of the Harrowhearth alongside you, and instead, you pelt him and me with the knowledge that she's dead. Priam never even had the chance to say goodbye; he didn't get that closure. As the one who sent her off on the mission where she was captured, it hurts to think that I killed Sarauthedes, even if indirectly. As the person who said goodbye, not knowing it might be the last time, grief burns inside of him, hollowing Priam out more than we realize. Thatch sat down and wrapped his arms and tail around his knees. \"But you're going to bring her back, right?\" Michrath's mouth thinned. \"We're going to try. I've demanded a lot from the gods these past few weeks. Despite all our efforts, we might not succeed. Sarauthedes could be lost to us forever.\" Don't say that, Thaddeus demanded silently over the rumble of Khrysalto's laugh. Please, don't say that! Sarauthedes was such a bright light that sparked in my life, however briefly. Say something else! Assure me, I beg you! But the priest had already moved away to continue his preparations. Thaddeus sat with his head in his hand, scarcely able to think for all his fear and worry. He'd only known Sarauthedes for a couple of months, and yet, her potential loss had this much of an effect on him? :You flesh and blood mortals are soft, weak, a puny, quavering afterimage in the shadows of us greater beings. This is precisely why you will never be anything more than prey animals to creatures like us! :\n\"Oh, stuff a sock in it, Khrys! I'm seriously not in the mood for gloating.\" The voice roared in his head. It hated being called Khrys, for so-called lesser beings should be using his full title to address him. \"Keep that up, and I will dig you out of my brain with my dirk!\" That shut him up. They both knew that without a host, the demonic spirit was nothing. Khyrysalto knew that if Thatch were to die without submitting to the hopelessness of failure, especially up in this foreign, sunlit world, his power would fade and shrivel, Khrysalto would become no more. Finally, at long last, Priam and Michrath had finished the ritual preparations.", "They ordered the puce-skinned Khindre to step back and took their places, the half-elf outside the circle of stones and gems, and Priam within. They both took a deep breath, and the chanting began. It was a long, slow ritual. Thaddeus had seen holy power at work through Sarauthedes, which had been life-changing. Before that point, he'd doubted anyone could command such ability to call flames and balms from the heavens, even while trapped miles underground. He'd seen amazing things from Sarauthedes. Still, bringing someone back to life? Without a body? It seemed exceptionally far-fetched to be true. But, still, Thatch sat there, grass cushioning his bottom, and watched for the hour it took for the spell to complete. It was honestly quite dull. There were no leaping flames or glowing orbs of silver light, anything like Thaddeus had gotten used to seeing with Sarauthedes around. Then, just as Thatch was starting to nod off, he felt a distinct change in the air. Priam had gone still and was staring into the sky, had been for well over fifteen minutes. Then, as Thaddeus watched, all of the gems interspersed in the circle of stones began to glow softly, like the world's most precious candles. They began to lift into the air, rotating minutely, before gathering off to the side, in another, smaller circle Michrath had made with silver wire and sticks. As they clinked into each other, their glow intensified, and it seemed to Thaddeus as if they were shattering, vaporizing into nothing more than fragments of pure light. Like someone putting together an old, familiar puzzle, the flecks of light gathered into a single conglomerate. With each glittering bit that joined the whole, the nexus' radiant glow intensified until it became so bright that Thaddeus had to look away. Even through his eyelids, the light burned, scarring a halo into the back of his vision. When at last he sensed the glow had died down, Thatch opened his eyes. And he couldn't believe what he saw. Sitting dazedly on the grass was a girl. Her skin was the same crimson hue as fresh roses, peeking through various slits in her ragged clothing, hair white and soft as dandelion fluff. Eyes like pools of silver cast around as if she were trying to make sense of where she was, while white, angelic wings flapped lazily behind her back. Thatch didn't even give her a chance to make sense of her surroundings. Almost instantly, he was there, pushing past Priam and pulling the only woman with such a unique form into the tightest of embraces. Sarauthedes gasped, strangling a scream of surprise, as her mind cleared, and she recognized Thaddeus. Holding her like this, seeing her returned from the dead, inspired a whole host of emotions in him. But, the one he grasped onto was the realization of just what losing Sarauthedes had meant to him. He knew now that watching her die to the servants of that corrupted draconic amalgam had been like experiencing the death of a beloved older sibling. The way Sarauthedes clutched tight to him, and the relieved, fond smile that washed over her seraphic features, told Thatch that she felt much the same way. \"I can't believe it; you're actually alive,\" he sobbed. \"I'm so sorry, Sarauthedes. I wasn't good enough; I couldn't save you.\" \"Shhh,\" she soothed, pulling his face away so that he could look into her eyes. \"Don't assign blame to yourself for things you had no power to control.\" \"But, I wasn't there when you needed me most, Sarauthedes,\" Thaddeus protested. \"The one time when you needed allies by your side, I abandoned you, left you to face your trials alone. I promise you; I'll not fail you. Not again, never again.\" \"Truth be told, Thatch, I wasn't suited to survive down there, in the Harrowhearth. I'm a daughter of sunshine and flowered meadows, not of steel and bloodsoaked stone. What happened was inevitable, I think.\" \"How can you be so calm about this?\" Thaddeus wondered incredulously. \"You died!\" \"Because that's what you need right now,\" Sarauthedes replied sweetly, patting the Khindre's cheek. \"If I started freaking out, you would too. And that wouldn't do. Today's a day for celebration, not worry.\" \"Are you some sort of angel, Sarauthedes? How else could you be so perfectly gracious?\" Sarauthedes shrugged and flapped her wings. \"I suppose these might impress that image on your mind. But, speaking of angels, you might want to let go of me before Priam starts getting jealous.\" \"Oh, so you do know him?\" Thatch wondered. \"You didn't mention him down there. Seems like sort of a jerk.\" \"Hey,\" Sarauthedes pouted, \"don't you go calling my boyfriend a jerk. I'll have you know; he's plenty charming and very sweet on me to boot. If he's not been the kindest to you, it's probably because he doesn't understand how the bond between us works. That means, for the sake of his honor and mine, he was obligated to be jealous.\" \"I won't believe it until I see it, but I guess I can't keep him away for long.\" \"Nor would I let you keep us apart. And, Thatch, I know you don't have the heart to keep me from being happy.\" \"You've got that right, at least,\" the Khindre groaned. \"Alright, I'll let him have his chance. But if he tries anything stupid.\" Sarauthedes shook her head. \"Yes, yes, my dearest little brother will rush in to protect me.\" She laughed with such genuine life in her voice, unlike anything he'd heard down in the Harrowhearth. \"I love you, Thatch. Now please, scamper off and let me say hello to my other friends.\" No matter how little trust the Khindre had for these other people, and despite his vow of protection, Thatch respected and adored Sarauthedes too much to deny her request. \"At least you're back,\" he sighed to himself.", "\"That's enough for me.\""], "summaries": ["Thaddeus wakes up to the sunlight after months of being trapped underground, relieved yet uncertain about his family's fate, while struggling with his newfound draconic scales.", "Thatch, haunted by memories of bloodshed and loss, struggles to control his inner turmoil as he embarks on a mysterious journey with Priam and Michrath, two strangers who show him unexpected kindness and trust.", "After emerging from the warmth underground into the chilly late spring air, Thatch grapples with his inner struggle as Khrysalto's voice taunts him about past traumas and missed opportunities.

She sat in the porch swing, swaying a little as she tried to read The Key to Extraordinary to distract herself from her swirling emotions. The aroma of bacon and eggs slowly crept out of the house and found its way to her nose, letting her know what mom was cooking. Usually, breakfast was her favorite meal, but today she didn’t care as much.How could her mom just give up on her dad and then move forward with someone new so soon? Didn’t he or their family mean anything to her? Dodie had zero interest in meeting a “new dad” and stepbrothers and sisters tomorrow evening, but she had no choice. She really had little choice about anything in her life it seemed these days.Some wrens started chirping happily in a tree nearby, so Dodie put the book away so she could put some more seeds in the feeder, which was a few feet from the porch. The wrens and the squirrels always looked as if they didn’t have a care in the world. She wished she was as free as they were.Returning to the swing, she found that the slow, easy rhythm calmed her nerves a lot. But the bottom of her aqua-colored Nikes kept thumping against the wood surface of the porch. Those thumps came quicker and quicker as she began to swing harder and faster, each thump a secret protest against what was going on in her world.But then, her golden lab, Finn, barked twice at her, trying to get her attention. He'd been lifting his nose every few seconds to take in the wonderful, familiar smell of crispy bacon. Hopping onto the swing, he began tugging at her sleeve. She pulled her arm away and scowled at him.“No, Finn. We aren’t going in yet. Sit.”Finn whined a little, tried to sit obediently for a few seconds, but eventually he got in her lap to stare her down with his big brown eyes. The guilt trip didn’t work. So, he whimpered one final time, then got down out of the swing to lay at her feet.It was then that she noticed a boy a few yards down the street making his way toward her on a skateboard.", "He was wearing a short-sleeved Mossy Oak shirt and blue jeans. After a few seconds, he had already made it to the end of the driveway.“Hey, girl, what’s your name?”  This was always a delicate subject. She'd never liked the name “Dorothy” because it sounded too old school. Her little cousin, Jill, was only two when she'd dubbed her with the name \"Dodie.\" Her efforts to pronounce Dorothy always failed. So, after that, everyone else began calling her Dodie. She was glad cause she liked it so much better.Now, hiding behind her wire-rimmed glasses, Dodie didn’t look up at the boy nor did she answer him. Irritation was coursing through her brain as she mumbled under her breath... Oh, just go away. Then, she remembered there was no need to be mean. She tried breathed a long deep breath, imagining her veins were filled with cool water. By the time she was ready to answer him,  just go away boy was already gliding back down the road in the opposite direction pretty fast. However, a couple of minutes later, he had made a circle and started heading back in her direction. Oh lord. She could feel the butterflies rising up in her stomach.As he got there, the boy stopped short, angling and sliding so sharply that his board skidded a little sideways. What a showoff, she thought.But he was the first kid around there to even talk to her. Biking, roller blading, and boarding were things most of the kids in the neighborhood did for fun, even the younger ones. It was ok since there wasn’t much traffic on that street and there was a skate park a little further down. The older kids liked to make small ramps to practice their jumps with at home, but she really didn’t know much about their habits other than that. She was always too busy reading, making good grades, planning her future, and basically being a nerd.And now the boy would be expecting an answer from her...Dust waffled upward and outward as the boy got off the board and flipped it upward with his foot.", "She quickly turned her head to the side, hoping he hadn’t seen her looking at him, but he had already begun to walk toward her with confidence in his stride. His hand went up to shield his eyes from the sun as he stopped in front of the porch where she was.“Hey,” I’m pretty sure I know you. ” His breath was a little ragged and sweat was dripping from his forehead. He wiped this away with his forearm, then flipped his sandy skater-cut hair out of his eyes.Dodie met his gaze for a few seconds. She didn’t know him from Adam and she really didn’t think she wanted to. But then he pressed a little further,“I live in a different neighborhood, but my dad's brother works down the street. I know your last name is Johnson because that’s what it says on your mailbox,” “My brother Drew says your first name is Dorothy. Is that right?”He chuckled a little and there was a touch of mischief in his voice.Glaring at him, she replied,“No, it’s Dodie. Don’t ever call me that name. What do you want?”“Whoooa, sorry.” The boy threw his hands up , “ No need to bite my head off.”Immediately, Dodie felt bad for having been rude to a stranger, so she spoke a lot softer this time.“I’m sorry, I just have a lot on my mind. It’s nice to meet you. What’s your name? ”“I’m Braden. My folks moved into the green house down by Davis lake a little over a year ago. When I come over to Drew's house, I've seen you outside a few times. He works at the convenience store down the road. You’ve probably seen him there, right?”“Yeah, I think so. \"Glancing down at his board and back at her, he asked,“Well, do you skate?”“ No. A couple of years ago one of my cousins left his board at dad’s house and I tried to ride it a little, but right away I skint my knee up real bad. I don’t think skateboarding is for me. But I do have my bike here. \"“Yeah, I think I saw you riding it once or twice. So, your dad doesn’t live with you guys?”Dodie’s chin dropped a little. “No, my mom and dad are divorced. Dad moved out about a year ago. Now she’s got a new boyfriend. He and his kids are coming over tonight for supper.”“No problem. I understand,” Braden answered, “Don’t worry, it will be ok. You’ll see,” then gave her a thumbs up as if to say, Trust me, it will be fine.She stood there wishing she had his confidence that everything would be ok. Why did everyone else except her think her parents’ divorce wasn’t that big a deal?", "The worst part was she sometimes felt it was her fault. Maybe if she’d been a better kid, they would be together. When she first found out, it hurt so much that her breath caught in her throat, almost strangling her. She’d even tried to clean up her own act, hoping it would change their minds, but they still got the divorce anyway. When she thought about a new dad replacing hers, hot anger would always start to burn in her chest.“I don’t care about meeting this new boyfriend of hers or his kids,” her voice was tight and her eyes glowered as she said it.“I kinda understand how you feel. A couple of years ago, my oldest sister, Jemma, married this guy and later she divorced him. Mom and her, him, and the rest of us kids were all living together in his house at that time. I was kinda mad at first that we had to find a new place and move after she divorced him. And, weirdly, I kinda missed the idea of them being together after he left. But I realized soon enough that she is better off now without him. I didn't know it then, but the guy was hitting her when nobody else was around. This guy she is with now, Charles, he’s so much nicer to her. She's happy. She talks about him all the time.”“That’s funny. My uncle's name is Charles, too, but everybody calls him Chuck.” “Really? That’s weird,” he said with a chuckle. They both went quiet for a few seconds, but then Braden thought of an idea.“Hey, do you wanna come watch me at the skate park down the road this afternoon? You’ll love it. It’s pretty rad. There are some pretty sick skaters there. In fact, I’m pretty good, myself.”His lips curved up into a full grin and his sandy eyebrows arched upward for emphasis when he said ‘sick,” like it was a inside term only for skaters, and she should know it.“Maybe after breakfast.”She wasn’t that hungry yet, but she figured if she left the yard her mom would worry unless she told her where she was going. She was very adamant about when people ate their breakfast.“Hey, I’m sure mom wouldn’t mind you coming in and eating some with us,” she said, “You hungry?”Braden nodded. “Yeah, I’m starving. My mom doesn’t cook most mornings. She’s a big coffee drinker. I usually go back home and make myself a Pop Tart or else some Pizza Rolls after I ride, but we’re out of everything. She gets paid tomorrow.”So, they went inside and her mom made them each a plate of bacon, eggs, grits, and homemade biscuits.", "Braden smacked his food. Anyone would have thought he’d never had biscuits with gravy.“Wow, your mom is a great cook.”“I know,” Dodie had to hold back her laughter then because right about that time he spilled some gravy on his shirt.Afterwards, Dodie’s mom said was fine if they went to the skate park as long as Dodie was back around 2 p.m. So, they went back outside, and walked together to the convenience store, with Braden carrying his board the whole way and asking her about her likes and dislikes and telling her his. He seemed to have manners, considering he was a boy. She hadn’t met too many she liked, but he seemed ok.When they got to the store, he introduced her to his brother, who was standing behind the register, counting change back to a customer. Braden paid for them both a bag of chips and a Coke to drink later if they got hungry or thirsty again, then they were off to the skate park.Watching many others who were skating there, it was obvious there were some real pros among the kids in the neighborhood. She admired how they could do all the crazy jumps, spins, and other tricks and not bust their asses. She knew she could never be as good no matter how much she practiced.After finishing his last jump, Braden finally skated over her, then screeched to a stop right in front of where she stood, making her think he was going to slam into her. She jumped, then laughed at herself. Bryan nearly doubled over laughing too, but then he told her he was sorry for scaring her. In spite of how she had been feeling before all this, she was now beginning to feel much better.“Hey, you wanna try it? Its really fun once you get the hang of it.”When she said, no, he motioned in the direction of his brother's house.“Tomorrow, we’ll go down to Drew's house and grab a couple of boards. I’ll teach you.”The next day, Braden's aunt answered the door when they arrived and invited them both in. Not wanting attention to herself, Dodie waited outside for him to return. After waiting while, she got bored and started playing on her phone. Finally, he returned.“There’s a concrete slab foundation out back where they were going to build another small house, and just never got around to it. Let’s go back there and I’ll teach you some beginner moves.”When they got behind the house, he said,“Ok, the first thing we gotta do is figure out your correct stance,” he said, sounding like an expert.Once he'd placed the board sideways on the ground, he told her to jump over it while he watched to see which foot she landed on. She ended up landing on her right foot.“Ok, right foot forward, You’ve got the goofy stance,” he laughed proudly, clapping his hands.“That doesn’t surprise me, at all, cause I’m always goofy,” she chuckled back.After a few practice push-offs, Dodie was gliding on the board, amazed that she was actually skateboarding for the first time! She had never felt so free in her life, at least not since learning how to ride a bike for the first time.As they walked back to her house, Dodie was thinking her mom might be worried by now because it was already about 4 and their company was set to arrive at 6. She was hoping she wasn’t about to get a tongue lashing. Luckily, they were almost there.As they reached the edge of her driveway, Braden said, “You did great today.”But then, they both heard a text message pinging from one of their phones. She grabbed hers out of her pocket, but quickly saw there was no messages on hers. Looking back up, she realized that Braden was quickly typing a reply back to someone on his.“Hey, I have to go. My dad just texted my mom that he and I and my sister have to go somewhere tonight. I didn’t know until now. I have to go home and get ready.” Braden said, seeming apologetic. “That’s ok. I had fun today. See you later.” She smiled at him and waved as he pushed off on his board. As she watched him glide, she silently hoped that she would get to do this again. They'd had so much fun.She went inside the house to find that her mother was frantic.“What took you so long?", "You know we have company tonight. Now get showered and dressed. You have about 30 minutes.”“Sorry, I lost track of the time, mom. I’ll get ready now. It won’t take long.”“Do you even know what you’re going to wear? Please, anything other than blue jeans and a t-shirt. How about that blue dress that looks so nice on you that your dad got you for Easter last year.”“No way. I'll just put on some nice khakis and that white ruffled blouse, but not a dress.”“Ok, that’s fine, but do it quickly!”After getting ready, Dodie made her way down the stairs to find that her mom had made a nice dinner of fried chicken, mashed potatoes, cornbread, green beans, and macaroni & cheese ready at the table ready for the company. It wasn’t a great surprise, because that was one of her mom’s favorite fall backs for their family gatherings. Instead, what did surprise her was who was sitting in the living room, waiting for her.Sitting on the love seat was a girl named Kim, who was close to her age, but what what really amazed her was who was sitting on the couch right next to her mom's boyfriend. It was Braden, the same boy she had just spent the day with! She smiled really big and said,\"It's you!! I can't believe this! \"Smiling back, Branden replied,\"Yeah, me either. Who woulda guessed this could happen. \"After everyone ate, they all sat down to play Uno, then Monopoly, and Pictionary. Maybe she was going to fit into a new family better than she thought. She still loved her dad, and wished things could have worked out, but maybe her mom moving on wasn’t going to be so bad after all.But then she wondered if Braden had known all along that her mom and his dad were dating.", "If he did, though, why didn’t he say anything about it? Sitting down next to him on the couch, she asked, “Did you know already that your dad was my mom’s boyfriend,”“No, I didn’t,” he replied, ‘It’s pretty wicked, though, huh?”“Yeah, it’s actually pretty cool,” she said, still feeling a little puzzled about it all. When her mom’s boyfriend and his family got ready to leave, everyone was hugging everyone else and saying bye. So, Dodie held out her arms to give Branden a hug, too, but, at first he resisted it. Instead, he put his hand on top of her head and started mussing up her hair, teasing. “Quit that.” She moaned.“Ya know, you’re not bad for a kid sister. I am one year older than you, so I can call you that.” He chuckled, then put one arm around her shoulders.“You’re not so bad for a brother either. But one year older isn’t enough to call somebody a ‘kid sister,” Dodie jibed back at him, giggling, opening the front door for them to go outside.After he left, she thought of how they would be having so many adventures together. This was only the beginning."], "summaries": ["Dodie spends her morning grappling with mixed emotions about her mom's new relationship, seeking solace in her surroundings until she's interrupted by the arrival of a boy on a skateboard.", "A shy girl named Dodie, who prefers to be called Dodie over Dorothy, encounters a boy on a skateboard who initiates a conversation with her, sparking her curiosity and causing butterflies in her stomach.", "A chance encounter unfolds between Dodie and Braden, leading to a conversation about her family situation and an unexpected display of understanding and support from Braden.

He was scared when the incident happened. He did not tell Roberta he had lost one of his legs. He got caught up trying to save another fellow soldier and got shot several times. He tried several times coming out with the incident but did not know how to tell her. Roberta is a strong woman but he felt this would really put a strain on their relationship.

He knew this would help so much to have the family he truly wanted. Desk jobs, cutting potatoes, feeding the troops called for more than he could handle. He longed to be back into the field, but God has a plan for us all and he had something more for Kane. Roberta knew there was something going on but because they was so far apart she did not want to add any more to the distance they were was facing. She stayed busy and she stayed prayerful.

They went through so much that year in 1983 and beyond and she was not going to let go. That goes to show you, no matter what you may face in life, just take the time to know how much you are blessed.

Far too mundane and commonplace an event for the reunion I had in mind, a reunion that I'd been visualizing over and over and over and over again since the day he left for Australia seventeen years ago. Besides, I'm nowhere near handsome enough to pull off an ugly sweater. There are those that are and I hate them for it! All except for Paul of course. I could forgive him anything. Paul could throw on a pair of  old musty sweats, forget to run a comb through his hair, show up late for a brunch, and still manage to be so disconcertingly handsome that I had to remind myself that I couldn't gape at him all the way through eight mimosas and a second-rate Eggs Benedict. It only got worse when he smiled, which was pretty much all the time. His near 'perfect white teeth' grin was a tremendous part of his appeal. Who wouldn't want to be responsible for, or at the very least imagine they were responsible for that look of resplendent delight that lit up his face as if he'd found nirvana. (Think Robert Redford in \"The Way We Were\") No, an ugly sweater party would never do.", "Over the years since his departure, we hadn't really kept in touch. (his fault, not mine) We'd exchanged messages on Facebook all of about five times. Yes, FIVE times, all of which I'd initiated. Ordinarily, I would have made quick work of severing ties with someone who showed such an insulting lack of interest in maintaining a friendship. I had my pride after all, just.... not when it came to Paul, perhaps because I had always been secretly in love with him. As soon as it had become apparent that I was all but forgotten, I resorted to stalking him on social media. Don't you dare judge me! I know it sounds pathetic, and may very well be pathetic, but you never met Paul. I followed him on Twitter. I subscribed to his YouTube channel \"Better Hair For A Better Tomorrow\". I read his near daily blog even though the subject held little interest for me. After all, how much is there to say about the \"Coffee Culture In the Modern World\". Last but not least, I also 'liked' each and every single one of his status updates on Facebook, even the ones about his fucking cat, even the ones that included a picture of him and his asswipe husband Sergio, a man he'd met and married a mere seven months after he arrived in Sydney. Not to sound petty or anything, but he never once 'liked' any of my posts, not even the ones I thought had been especially clever. And yet,... and yet..... my obsession lingered. Before you get the wrong idea, there was never any real possibility of me becoming a dangerous stalker. I'm just not the type. No racine filled envelopes, no threatening letters and phrases cut out from \"Elle\" magazine, a publication we had always languidly flipped through the moment it hit the stands. No purchases of shotguns or razor sharp Bowie knives, no homemade fertilizer bombs, if only because I wouldn't be able to get them on the goddamn plane. (Kidding!) I had; however,imagined his husband dying in a plethora of freak, tragic accidents, but I would like to think we've all done that from time to time. Most people say \"No\" when you ask, but I know they're lying. Even Paul lied about it once. At first he gave me this really strange look, as if I'd just bitten into a live rat, then he shook his head and said, \"God NO!! What kind of horrible person would entertain such a thought?\" As I said before though, I could forgive Paul anything, though it took me a while to forgive him that. It was on an ordinary humdrum Wednesday afternoon, just a few weeks before Christmas, that I saw the Facebook post I'd been yearning for, praying for, and often considered making deals with the devil for.", "Paul announced to the world, or at least to his 4,372 'friends', that he'd decided to leave his husband, something about about an affair or growing apart, I'm not quite sure. I had stopped paying attention the second I'd read he would be returning to Seattle, sans asswipe husband Sergio. I must have read those words a hundred times, just to make sure I had the right of it. I even went so far as to spill a cup of scalding hot coffee all over my lap just to make sure I wasn't dreaming. After a couple, or several dozen ouches and yelps and assorted obscenities, I went back to reading and rereading the long awaited news, with as much fascination as Trump feels the public pays his endless tweets. After a good twenty minutes of constantly reassuring myself that the miraculous had at long last come to pass, I jumped up from my desk with an exuberant \"YES! \", which made it the second time I had leaped up from my chair that afternoon, the first time following the hot coffee fiasco. Anyway, second degree burns or no, \"OPERATION COOKIE\" could now finally be put into action.", "A few days after his post, or perhaps it was only a couple of hours, I sent him a message expressing my excitement over his imminent return to the States. I casually mentioned that I would be more than happy to throw him a \"Welcome Home Cookie Exchange Party,\", complete with a red carpet, trumpets, streamers, the ubiquitous paparazzi, etc. He responded with a bloody laughing face emoji. God how I loathe emojis!They are nothing more than the lazy man's version of a complete sentence. Adhering to my incessant compulsion to forgive Paul anything, I magnanimously chose to overlook this modern faux-pas and simply spent the rest of the day congratulating myself that I had supposedly gotten him to laugh. If only I could see the psychotically positive side to more things in this life, why I would be the happiest man alive. The very next day I began work on the invitations, complete with calligraphy and gold leaf on a sinfully expensive and imported onion skin stationery. There are those who will say that this was way over the top for a cookie exchange party, but sometimes a cookie exchange party isn't just a cookie exchange party. Sometimes it's a new beginning. Why a cookie exchange party in the first place you ask? The answer is a simple one. Cookies were Paul's favorite stoner snack. The one he cherished above all was the Madeleine. They were \"sheer perfection\" he said. Sometimes I wondered though if it wasn't so much the taste he was enraptured with, or just the opportunity to say the name \"Madeleine\" in his embarrassingly horrific French accent. (Insert forgive Paul anything)\n \nLuckily, considering the fact that each invitation took about 3 hours to make, there were only seven guests.", "Why would I want Paul's focus diluted with an endless stream of people coming and going and leaving crumbs all over my Persian rugs. Finally, the day arrived, December 16th. The party began at 7, with the first six guests having the good manners to arrive within the first thirty minutes. Needless to say, Paul was not among the six. (forgive, Paul, anything) He showed up at 8:20, yes 8:20, after four of the six guests had already made their exits. None of that mattered though when I answered the door, and there was Paul, just as perfect as I'd remembered him. (It didn't dawn on me until later that he wasn't holding a container of cookies.) All I noticed was his Robert Redford face, not a wrinkle or a gray hair to mark the passage of time. One thing I'll give him credit for was that he very graciously let me drink in the sight of him for a good ten minutes before I thought to invite him in and give him a far more cursory hug than I would have liked. (When the person you're hugging keeps his arms at his sides, a lingering hug soon becomes awkward.) Initially, I had planned to let him mingle and unwind a while before I unveiled my big surprise, but fuck it, there were only two guests left and I just couldn't wait another second. With trembling hands, I picked up a silver platter from a small table in the entryway and lifted off the dome with a courtly flourish to reveal one dozen perfect Madeleines. When I say perfect, I mean P-E-R-F-E-C-T!!! I'd been spending many a Sunday afternoon trying out various recipes, one after the other, making my own laudable modifications along the way. Practically prancing up and down, I trilled \"Madeleines, Madeleines. Your favorite, I remembered! I remembered your favorite cookie!\" He then looked at me with a deadpan face and asked me if they were gluten-free. That's when I told him to get the fuck out of my house."], "summaries": ["A reunion was brewing in the storyteller's mind for years, centering around a charming and effortlessly handsome man named Paul, who had a captivating smile that could light up any room.

Some of them you have to swallow like shards of glass that cut your throat. Iron fills your nose and lays upon your tongue. Some of them taste like rotten meat, but it’s the texture that really does you in. Thick like tar, so thick you choke and gag. Lies like that make it hard to breathe and are even harder to say. And some lies, some lies are sweet. The taste of chocolate, of packaged cookies and candy bars. Irresistible and addicting, ones you can’t just say once, you have to go back to again and again and again. Some, a hard candy, which you suck and let sit in your mouth, unaware of the way it can lodge in your throat. I think those kinds of lies are the ones we want to believe.

The truth was like spoiled milk, without even tasting it, just a whiff of the scent, and you knew it was bad. I didn’t know how to say it, I felt like I couldn’t. At least in the moment, I was certain of that. Looking back, the lie, it wasn’t for her. It was for me. I liked the way it tasted, liked the idea of what it would keep together.

The cadence and pitch are always wrong and the voices chase me down hallways to the basement, to my room and still the arguments can be heard.

The lid clamped on tight. The fire is low, but never stops. All day that pressure builds. The pot hisses and bubbles, simmers and steams but the lid isn’t removed until he’s home and she is there.

Houses were decorated and lit all up and down the town. There were no dark houses in our neighborhood. The more decorations and porch lights we saw the more excited my little goblin became. We were meeting up with her Cousin and my sister to trick or treat in the neighborhood in which we grew up.", "My sister, D3, and I don't spend much time together outside of the holidays, so it was going to be nice to catch up a little. The cousins were excited to see each other in costume and talked animatedly about the night to come, and then suddenly they both turned to us and said, \"Can WE go trick or treating by ourselves? Just us? Please we are old enough. We're together. And you guys know EVERYONE so you can find us. Please. Pleeeeese.\" D3 and I looked at each other, seeing no help in the other, we quickly glanced to Mom who said, \"Well, they are getting older, and they will be together.\" I KNOW she didn't say that to me until I was too old to care, what the ... okay, no help from Mom. D3 and I are looking at each other, and with no help, we agreed, set the limits, took pictures, reminded The Cousins of their limits, kissed them like they were going off to fight a war, and then watched them walk away.", "I'm not sure who spoke the thought first, but someone said, \"We said they could go alone, no said we couldn't follow.\" Cue the Mission Impossible music. I was in my late 20s, early 30s, D3 is older than I, neither of us was in the best shape of our lives, but I'll be damn, we had decided we were going to follow our girls, and be ... stealthy. The Cousins were heading down our side of our dead-end street, something I promise you was not considered when this adventure began, if I'm honest, nothing was considered before this adventure began. Yet, here D3 and I are, trailing behind 2 little girls, ducking into the shadows of bushes, cars, whatever, while watching The Cousins. What neither of us had looked at or considered in those first few moments, were the other trick or treaters, and most specifically, their parents. All of a sudden, as we duck into the shadow of a truck, the lights turn on, we dodge for the bush's shadow, and paused to catch our breath.", "The Cousins are 4 houses in, we can see the next 4, so we are good for a bit, I look at D3, she finally looks at me, and the laughter starts, but doesn't get fully going before we hear someone clear their throat. We look up to see our neighbor, looking concerned. Then realizing they know us, and looking confused. The laughter that was paused bubbled out. D3 shushed me. The neighbor started to say something, but The Cousins were going out of sight. I whispered over my shoulder, \"Our girls THOUGHT they were old enough to trick or treat alone.\" As D3 and I started running through the lighted area, and falling behind a family. The Dad turned around. D3 said, \"The Cousins think they are old enough to go without us.\" The parents smiled, wished us luck, and provided cover as The Cousins crossed in front of them. Black Widow we were not. We thanked them, and moved back into the shadow. All in all, trailing behind them on our street, was kind of a piece of cake, it definitely built our confidence way too much.", "The Cousins were at Mrs. D's house, the last house on our street, wait, we don't know people on the other street, shit, too late, there go The Cousins. As D3 and I are trying to keep our eyes on The Cousins, we missed seeing Mrs. D, who laughed at us, asked if we had been drinking, said, \"Oh you girls\" and gave us candy. The Cousins had made it to the next street, the street itself was no more issue than ours had been. Except. We were BEHIND The Cousins, and they would get home first.", "D3 and I decide to run the back yards and get home first. Yards we hadn't RUN in a loooong time. Yards that did not exist when we were kids. Yet, we took off for all we were worth, trying. Cue 3 Stooges music. There were bushes we tripped over. There was a hole one of us fell in. There was a clothesline we don't talk about. All the while D3 and I are howling with laughter.", "As we made it Mom's back yard we could see The Cousins between the houses. D3 and I were going to make it there before them, just barely, maybe. We RAN the back yard. Hurtled the 3 steps in 2 leaps. Tore opened the backdoor.

The world was full of splendor and every moment held a ticket to a new adventure and she held the key to each new door she chanced upon. Any concern I expressed to her of her need to rest fell upon deaf ears. As her ears only heard the melody of her song in the world. Our Earth was a glorious creation that she was meant to explore, and that is just what she intended to do! She glided through life on the wings of time, she seemed to be everywhere at once. Her excitement in each moment was intoxicating, and that, I think, is why I enjoyed being a part of her world so very much. I must say, I never met anyone like her! Nor do I expect to in this lifetime. With her, I explored the caves of the indigenous tribes, the hieroglyphics of the Egyptians, the Inca pyramids, I danced with the Natives and sailed the seas in search of lost treasures.", "I gazed at the stars in wonder as I learned there is so much more than I thought ever existed. I traveled the world and welcomed the lessons of my soul. Through her, I felt I would never grow old. She tasted all of God’s creation with a hunger I could never match as she stopped to smell every flower and drink of its nectar. Her gentle touch tickled each flower peddle as she greeted each bloom by name. She left each unscathed, just as they were when first she came. She stopped to thank each and every tree along her way, for the life-giving gift they delivered and she wondered at the length of their days and all that they might endure. She engaged with all of this with an innocence that was so humble and pure. And her beauty!", "Her beauty was such that none could compare! Of this, I am sure, she was unaware. Yes! Life was her lottery, and she held the winning ticket. She had no time for worry and concern, she was so full of life, with ambition she went about her way, determined not to overlook the wonder in even the smallest of things.

The splendor of it all!” She would exclaim as she reached the shore of a distant beach, I honestly believe she would have counted every grain of sand and gave each living creature a special name if she had had the time.

She experienced each second of her life, engulfed in the blessings she was bestowed, she never failed to thank her creator for it all. She was always welcomed, wherever she would go! At times I was in total awe of her ability to give so much of her amazing self, she was a free spirit! She was never burdened with the worries of my world, she brought light where there may be darkness, and hope to those who had none, and with such ease and grace, she spread love to all that she encountered along her way.

Her friend, Peggy, had set it up. Telling her that the man was handsome and charming who had a good job and had been single so quiet a bit of time. Looking at her text messages she went back to check the information, “He’s wearing a dark blue shirt, hmm... okay.”  \n\tChecking out the fancy restaurant, she made her way to the cocktail bar, sitting at one of the high tables.", "She felt slightly overdressed with her form fitting pale blue dress — at least she thought ahead and wore smaller heels than she originally planned. She waited a couple more minutes, looking around to see if she could find her mystery date. “Ma’am, this came from the gentleman over there.” The bartender interrupted, sliding a red dirty martini her way as he pointed to the man in question. Jessie was pleasantly surprised, “Oh... thank you.” she turned and smiled at the man, who waved and was wearing a dark blue shirt. He made his way over and took a seat next to her, “Hi, I’m Mark.” \n\t“Jessie.", "It’s nice to meet you.” She could see why Peggy told her he was handsome and charming, his smile alone was dashin, and his blue eyes were sparkling. The next few minutes they spent introducing one another and lightly flirting. Jessie was having much more fun than she had expected to have with a blind date. Mark ordered them an appetizer from the menu which they shared as they continued talking. “So here’s a weird question,” Jessie started, her tone teasing. “What’s your best pick up line?”\n\tMark thought for a moment, “Your hand sure looks heavy, do you mind if I hold it for you?”  He said as he picked up Jessie’s hand. She laughed loudly at the cheesiness of such a line. “Very nice, very nice.” \n\tMark smiled, “Thank you, it’s not too shabby.” \n\t“Oh it’s terrible, but yes, not too shabby.” Jessie joked. “Well, let’s see you do better,” Mark challenged with a smirk as he took a sip of his drink. Jessie tapped her chin, before shyly putting her brown hair behind one ear. “You’re so handsome that you made me forget my pick up line.” \n\tMark hung his head as he chuckled. “That is much better than mine.” \n\tJessie grinned. She and Mark continued their delightful date until Mark’s watch beeped.", "“Ah, dang, my shift’s. I’m sorry.” Mark explained. “I would love to call you.” \n\tJessie wrote her number on a cocktail napkin and signed her name with it. “Here’s my number. Oh and I expect a call.” She raised an eyebrow and smiled. Mark kissed the back of her hand. “Yes ma’am.” He said his goodbyes and left. Jessie stayed, getting another drink as she thought about the best two hours she had in weeks.", "“Excuse me, is your name Jessie?” A man's voice asked. Jessie turned and saw a man with thick black glasses and curly auburn hair —  plus a dark blue shirt. “Yes?” \n\t“I’m Ian, Peggy set us up.” Ian said, giving a small shy grin. Jessie’s eyes widened. “Oh...” \n\t“Sorry I’m late, I got stuck in traffic.” He explained. Jessie’s eyebrows furrowed as she looked at her phone. If Ian was telling the truth, he was an hour and a half late for their date. She tried to put on a smile and waved her hand to the seat next to her. “Are you hungry?” \n\tIan took a seat and picked up the menu, “I’m vegan actually, so I’ll see what they have.” \n\t“Oh...” Jessie said somewhat stupidly. Ian gave her a delighted smile, Jessie was beautiful. Peggy was right, she seemed fun and carefree. “So, what do you do for a living?” He asked, his questions straightforward and a little rusty from disuse. Jessie laughed a little sarcastically, having explained all of this to Mark, who was apparently not her blind date. She repeated a lot of what she told Mark telling it now to Ian who showed little interest in what she did for work —  Jessie worked proudly as a phlebotomist at the local ER. Ian explained about his job and life as he ordered something to eat, not leaving any room for Jessie to ask questions or interrupt. It left Jessie feeling very much like there was going to be a test at the end of the night with a questionnaire included. Ian smiled as he took a drink of his club soda, continuing his talk about why his last girlfriend had left. He thought Jessie seemed very entertained. Jessie tapped her fingers on the table, her chin in her hand as she listened to Ian continue his monologue about his last relationship. She could see why the last poor girl had left. Time wasn’t moving nearly fast enough. At the end of the night Ian walked Jessie out of the restaurant, almost letting the door close on her as she exited.", "“Sorry about that.” Ian apologize. He held his hand out to shake. “It was so nice to meet you.” \n\tJessie had been irked for the last hour and a half of her night, with a tight lipped smile she took his hand and shook it firmly. “Oh please, the pleasure was all mine.” She said, a little miffed. She was tired, irritated, and most of all her feet hurt even in her low heels. Ian handed her his phone number. “Here’s my cell.” He said, putting it into her hand. Jessie opened her mouth to protest but by then the valet had brought Ian’s car around and he left without so much as a goodbye. Jessie rolled her eyes as she turned and threw his number into the trash, pulling up Mark’s contact information she sent him a text that she was free next Wednesday.", "He replied quickly and they set a date for the movies. There was no way Ian was getting a second date — that she was sure of. Ian drove home, calling Peggy to give her an update. “Hey! I think it went really well, Pegs. I’m looking forward to the next date.” \n\tJessie called Peggy as she waited for a taxi, “Yeah, sorry Peggy, but Ian’s not the one for me.” \n\tPeggy laughed at the contradicting reactions to the blind dates. “That’s not what he said.” \n\t“Oh...I’m sure he didn’t.” Jessie said sarcastically."], "summaries": ["Jessie arrives at the restaurant for a blind date set up by her friend.

If you haven’t been back in time, then you probably don’t own a time machine. You’ve never heard it? Well then, I’ll tell you.", "Yesterday; a short three thousand years from tomorrow; I traveled with a lepidopteran who would try to change the world. A lepidopteran is the scientific name for a caterpillar. (Yes, I am a scientist.) When I first found him, he was an ordinary creature, the shade of light brown, and practically worthless. He was so boring, I almost stepped on him. Well, actually I did kind of step on him. I felt sorry for the little worm, so I scooped up his guts and all that gross stuff and took him back to my lab. Once I got there, I set to work on my revolutionary idea. I filled a small vile with kerosene and vinegar, dumped that over a block of fine granite, and ground it together in my smoothie blender. For finishing touches, I added some space juice. I quickly dropped the caterpillar blob into the concoction, then I checked my recipe book one more time. “Allow brew one hour to take effect,” it read. So, I waited, and waited, and waited. Then finally the timer went off; unfortunately, it only marked the halfway point. I decided to take a nap. I awoke some time later to the smell of smoke, and something else unidentifiable. I got up, slipped on some purple and teal clogs, and walked back into the lab.", "What I saw gave me such a start that I crumpled to the ground like a tranquilized bear. I woke up to a colossal insect with his legs on my face. “Wake up, Moron!” He yelled. Then I fainted again. I opened my eyes, expecting to see a giant caterpillar, but I didn’t. “Just a hallucination.” I told myself. But what I saw in my lab told me otherwise. There wasn’t actually a lab there any more, just the floor. I could even see the trees and birds that I normally only saw through my windows through the wreckage. I quickly got up to tour the rest of my house. Finally, I found a five-foot-ten-inch caterpillar, angerly sorting through my refrigerator. Further investigation told me he had already visited the cupboards as well. “Who in the world are you?” I asked. Although I should have asked what he was. “I didn’t think you would be so big!” I both marveled and trembled at the creature I had created. “Whattarya talking about?! ?” Jerry mumbled. “I’ve always been this big!”\n\t“You mean you don’t even...” I trailed off as he moved into the next room to rummage around some more. “Well, it doesn’t really matter,” He replied curtly. “What does matter, is that you are out of giant milkweed.”\n\t“I never had any giant milkweed.” I replied confused. “What? No milkweed! How are you still living?” He looked horrified. “I get by,” I said cautiously. I was still terrified, but I tried my best not to faint again. “Well If I’m going to invent a time machine, then I need giant milkweed!” He exclaimed. “Excuse me?”, I frowned, “A time machine?”                                                                                      \n\tThe caterpillar clears his throat and looks at me gravely. “A minute ago, I had a vision,” he started dramatically.", "“In this vision, I was spoken to personally by The Big Pickle. He told me to invent a time machine, powered by the juice of an extra kosher dill pickle. If I fail...” He faltered. “Then the world as I know it... will... END! !” I stared at him Blankley for a few seconds, more like a few minutes. “Moron?” the caterpillar says, waving his leg-like thing in front of my face. “Pick up your clogs and let’s get moving! We need to get some giant milkweed and some magic pickle juice!”\n\tMuch later, after we somehow found some giant milkweed, Jerry, as I had come to know the strange cretin as, started on the time machine. “Ha!” he finally shouted after about an hour of staring at the wall.", "“It’s so simple!”\n\t“What is it?” I asked excitedly. “Is it a bird? A plane? Superman! ?”\n\t“Don’t be dumb, we just need one extra crispy Zistacrabbadooly!” He finishes triumphantly. “Uh, sorry but I’m fresh out of those.” I said, spreading my hands in helpless gesture. I was also disappointed that Superman wasn’t at the door. “Yes, I know,” Jerry nodded, “But you do have a refrigerator and a microwave. All you have to do is attach the fridge fan to the microwave cord, then you pickle it up!” I do have to admit that I was doubtful that an extra crispy Zistacrabbadooly would power a time machine, but once Jerry applied it to my Jeep and painted a bunny on the door, it actually looked pretty cool. (Minus the bunny part.) Jerry looked at his watch. Actually it was my watch, but Jerry did not seem to understand that not everything, in fact, belonged to him. “Holy butterflies!” He gasped. “We only have one hour before we have to leave!”\n\t“That leaves us plenty of time, right?”\n\tHe ignored the question. “You guard the time machine.” Then he ghosted back into the house. I waited, and waited, and took a nap, and waited.", "Finally, with two minutes to spare, Jerry rushed out of the house with a small tin box. “What’s in the box?” I questioned. “Brownies.” He said. “You can’t time travel without brownies.”\n           “Okaaay.” I raised an eyebrow. I couldn’t think of why brownies might help. “Are they for a specific purpose?”\nJerry looked me in the eyes, the disgust evident on his face, and shook his head slowly. “Brownies always have a purpose, Moron! I’m surprised you of all people wouldn’t understand that!”\nI stared blankly for the second time that day and grabbed the brownies from him. “I’ll put them in the back seat!” I sighed in exasperation. “Get in Moron! I’m applying the pickle juice!” I hopped into the time machine and fastened my seat belt.", "“Moron! Where’s the juice?” Jerry cried franticly. “I bought it this morning and set it on that shelf above the chainsaws. The caterpillar-man grabbed it and dumped it in the fuel tank. Jerry turned the key, and we took off in an explosion of purple and teal. Then I realized we were going so fast my purple and teal clogs had hit me in the face. Before I knew it, we were orbiting Pluto. As Jerry turned the jeep around to face earth, I heard a bang.", "“Uh oh.” Said Jerry. His bug-like face was shrouded with dread. “What is it?” I asked nervously. I was really hoping for Superman right about now. Jerry crawled into the back seat and grabbed the pickle jar. “NOOOOOOOOO!” He cried. “What! ?” I yelled back. “We used kosher dill pickles.” His voice lowered to a whisper. “That’s good right?” I whispered. Superman come quick. I was thinking to myself. “The Big Pickle said to use extra kosher dill, Moron! We only have twenty seconds to save the world, and all we have is plain kosher dill! He finished sadly. We watched out the window, waiting for the world to explode, or something like that. But Twenty seconds passed, then thirty, and still nothing happened. “Jerry,” I whispered excitedly. “The world didn’t explode, were okay!” \n\tJerry didn’t respond. “Jerry?” I said looking back.", "But Jerry was gone. In his place was a normal caterpillar\n\t“Oh,” I said aloud to myself. “Jerry’s world ended. He was too selfish to realize that. And now I’m lost in space.” I stared sadly back at earth, wishing I had never tried to save the boring caterpillar that Jerry was when I first found him. But now I knew I couldn’t change time, not even if I wanted to. Or could I?", "Being the scientist that I was, I drained the radiator, and mixed the juice with the kosher dill, turning it into extra kosher dill!” I refilled the fuel tank and held my breath as I turned the key. The Jeep roared back to life, and I yelled in triumph. I revved the engine and took off for earth. I set the dial to two days in the future of yesterday's future past, and pushed the time travel button. Then I was home. I walked down the lane, my clogs clumping like before, but this time I stopped in time to see Jerry crawling across the walkway. I bent down, close to the caterpillar. “Not this time buddy.” I smiled. Then I picked him up and set him on a stalk of milkweed. “You live a long life ok?” He didn’t answer me, of course, but I could almost hear his sarcastic answer: “Ok, Moron.”"], "summaries": ["In a world where time travel is possible, a mysterious story awaits those who journey back in time.", "A scientist experimented with a caterpillar using an unusual concoction in hopes of changing the world before encountering unexpected consequences.", "A scientist is shocked to wake up to a giant insect in his house, causing chaos as it searches for giant milkweed for a time machine.", "A person is tasked by The Big Pickle to invent a time machine fueled by pickle juice, or else face the end of the world, leading to a peculiar journey with a character named Jerry.", "Two friends work on a time machine using an unconventional ingredient and quirky methods, leading to a promising yet uncertain adventure ahead.", "Jerry and the protagonist prepare to time travel with a crucial tin box of brownies, emphasizing its importance for their quest as they embark on their journey.", "Jerry and the narrator accidentally end up orbiting Pluto after a mishap involving caterpillar-man and juice, leading to a surprising turn of events back towards Earth.", "Jerry and the protagonist panic over using the wrong pickles to save the world, but their fears are unfounded as nothing catastrophic happens in the end.", "After Jerry's disappearance, a transformed caterpillar prompts reflections on missed opportunities, regrets, and the possibility of altering time.", "A scientist successfully time travels back home after a unique adventure involving a transformed Jeep, time manipulation, and a humorous interaction with a caterpillar named Jerry."]}

We had gathered earlier at a corners inside the Secretariat waiting for the other come before we move enmass to see the officials.

Everyone was eyeing the man, Wondering where the anger and insult came from. Our CLO went to call others. The man was a master degree holders and ours was ordinary papers. I think it was insecurity. He had requested about two day back that we write our names and discipline as if it was forwarded to them before our arrival. Then it was time to introduce ourselves after which the man started enumerating what’s expected from us as if national service started with us. All this while, it was only his mouth talking, not his mind or eye. They were all dormant. “I know that you’re a born again, I went you to lead us in closing prayers” he pointed one girl out. Most of us that can see beyond our nose knew there was problem, the signs were in every words that came out of the man mouth. At times, it would sound as if he was talking to people from another country and not his country people. He was probably thinking that we Christians came to earn free money from the North as if their people weren’t posted to other regions. Most people in that Secretariat pretend to not understand and speak English and was taking to that idea till few months later, we came to realised that it was a ploy to cajole us into electing CLO from the North to be communicating with them.

Over there in a he North, there are bajillion of tribes but Religion hold them together. Hausa and Fulani tribes dominate others. Fulani’s dominated in Sokoto and most of the time, imposed their will on the Hausas that believed that Fulani’s were visitors. So, our new principal was a dominated fellow and frustrated too. He believed that he was more educated than the people controlling him, he found the situation unacceptable but has no choice but to accept. We was subjected to another introductory and familiarization bullshits. I personally think that the man made sure we earned every penny spent on us. The permanent staffs handed over their portfolios 90 percent to us and still, the principal looked the other way. The school timetable was redrafted whether to made sure to that we corners didn’t not forget their faces or something. We didn’t anyway.

Complete darkness. I might be tempted to touch my eyes to see if they’re closed but it wouldn’t be this dark if that was all it was.

Oh, they’re here.”\n“I guess Tess found the doorbell alright. I’ll open it. I’m already half out of my seat anyway. I’m going to try to crawl back there.

Judith, this is Captain Franklin and First Officer Douglas.”\n“Pleased to meet you, ma’am. I’d offer my hand but, you know.”\n“So it’s true, Captain, you two are blind as well?”\n“I’m afraid so, ma’am, but maybe, just maybe, with your daughter's help, we might get through this. The plane can land itself and in fact, it usually does. We just need to make sure some knobs get turned and some buttons get pushed at the right times. Now can I ask you, are you able to communicate with your daughter under these circumstances?”\n“Yes, yes. She has been signing to me by making the articulations against my palm. It’s a little clunky, but we’ve done it before, in the dark, on camping trips and once when the power was out. But-”\n“Oh that’s good news, Judith. Very good news. First Officer Douglas will try to point out to Sasha some information we need that’s displayed on the instruments. The first will probably be the Fuel Remaining. Next will be ETE. Now that’s Estimated Time En route, and then will go on from there. Okay?”\n“Yes, Captain, but-”\n“Please, ma’am, I’ll feel so much better once we have those two pieces of information. Can you ask her to do it now, please?”\n“Okay. -  Hold on. -  Okay, she’ll look. Can you hold still? We’re going to try to step around you.”\n“Understood. Holding still.

Their fingers tangle together in a way that can only happen during practices and performances. His hand slips around her back, mimicking the start of a tango, el paseo. He’s held women before, but the bond he has with her asks more of him. In other affairs, he was able to escape but this one is different. He wondered while performing if they were just that, performing, or if something else was happening. Aelina smiles back at him, there is playfulness in her eyes. “Drake, compliments won’t keep me from splitting my skull on the ice”, with this statement her small hands squeeze his. Their backs are straight and a distance is maintained between them. Aelina stares into his eyes. They are dark, heavy with focus, and a hint of something else. The music starts and their feet begin to glide across the ice. There is a swell of violins from the speakers that guide their movements. He slides her out, interlocking his hands with her. There is grace and force behind this action as they are moving at speeds increasing thirty-five kilometers per hour. He has a firm and guiding hand on her waist. As he does this, he can feel a small spark fight his focus. He was going to have to throw her in the air in a few short seconds. If his mind lingered in his draw to her anymore, it may lead to cracked ice and a bloody skull. “Drake, keep your eyes on your area!” The coach scolds loudly. As he’s brought out of his warm haze, he can feel a sobering cool illuminate from the ice. Aelina can feel anxiety creep into her body despite having done this before. He guides her into facing him. Aelina situates herself looking down as Drake is looking straight ahead and pushing in order to keep momentum. He allows her to slide out, their external arms and legs outstretched as the music begins to swell. He moves in, allowing her to stay somewhat extended until he slides behind her, acting as her net and support for the flight she is about to take. With this, he is careful to make sure she is prepared as he rips her out from his grasp, allowing her to spin like a top in the air. Relief brushes him as she lands it. Her posture resembles a ballerina as she is sliding backward with the same playful look she had earlier. “Beautiful!” The coach's loud voice echoes across the rink. His mind can’t focus on that though. For a moment, they are the only people on the ice. He can look at her, as they both move in motion across from one another. Her smile feels like a welcoming light, an angelic warmth that he looked for in their time together. [...]\n \nDrake steps out of the locker room.", "Bag on shoulder and skates laced between his fingertips, closing the door. The rink is cold and it remains so. His jacket that seems to usually do the trick fails to warm him. The foolhardy boy sees only what is in front of him as he refills his water. He takes a sip and his body is exposed to some form of warmth, the wearing off of the cool air is a shock to him. “I’m happy you didn’t crack my skull open.” Her voice is the echo of that shock that initially woke his body. Aelina’s presence was a general surprise to him. As a partner, she was forceful but still retained a fawn-like nature seen in an ingénue. If you only saw her performance you would assume she is a petite girl who fits easily into her partner, this disregarded the force of nature she actually was. Drake wipes his mouth and smiles at her. “Thanks, I’m happy it’s intact. I need my partner to be in one piece”, he spits out his answer trying not to spit on her. She laughs and it catches him off guard. He wonders if the look in her eyes holds the same intensity that rests in his. In these little moments, he wonders if there is shared chemistry that translates from their movement and coalescence in tandem with music to subtle conversations outside of it. “Also, you don’t have to grip so tightly at the beginning.” Drake spits out his drink as he remembers doing this. His mind was definitely not on what he was doing but rather how she was in his arms. He felt as though the constant reaching for her could be nullified in his silent longings being fulfilled at practice. His mind would absently trail off to the point where he could actually have her in reach, and she would be his. He feels embarrassed, as though she may be calling him out for something that is unintentional. “Oh man, I’m sorry. I didn’t realize-” \n“Drake, I’m just messing with you.” Her thin smile is filled with glee as she had playfully pulled the rug out from under him with such grace. He enjoyed how her teasing was intentional but gentle. “Oh?” The yearning boy gained a slight bit of his confidence back. “Yeah, you’re allowed to hold me.” As she said this, they fell into silence. The silence between them felt telling of something. Was it assurance in the reciprocation of feelings? Was it the same engulfing attraction that he has had to swallow whenever he was around her? “Aelina.” A voice calls from down the hallway. A tall, blonde and scowling boy of his age lingered at the end of the hallway. He had a brown trenchcoat that made him appear taller, and maybe even gave an aged intimidation factor to him despite how young his face appeared. “Jess!” Aelina rushes over to the tallboy. Her short arms struggle to loop around his neck to hug him. He has one hand and not both on her waist. For some reason, this bothers Drake. “I’ll see you, Drake.”\nDrake waves as his stomach twists.", "He is watching her latch onto him and yet he can’t pull his eyes away until they are out of sight.

The realization did not come immediately, why? Why did he want her like this? It is an Ego with a scattering of little carnal ones. It's sweet to feed him. An ordinary one would hardly agree to play by his rules, she couldn't see any deeper. Behind mercy is selfishness, behind well-being is a strong net. Is there a great or a small profit in sight? Is trust the key to love? Doubtful, given his true desire, that she should trust me. He didn't trust her. Not even the smallness of being, where you can rely on a delicious dinner or a warm hand on his chest. Strangely, he checks the food, moves farther away from her at night, the more shared, the greater the fear. Will she suffocate him? The idea of possession had grown from a constant pursuit of her to a maze of responsibility, somewhere in it now stood a cage, it materialized on its own from the creak of the key in the well, from the words, the scents of sweet, Arabic and buttery. Choking, and letting go was like death. The sheets lost their frosty freshness, the glass ceased to show reality. He had a choice to let go or...\n \n \n- The stakes were made...", "He summed up his actions in one phrase, not realizing he had signed. A month later... The big street is full of gray umbrellas, they gather in a huge pack, wolves, wolves are coming! No, they are already flowing a river at her feet. Andreas was trying to get everything, everything he could out of the little holes in his skull when he was trepanated – the memory leaked out along with the black blood. That was a long time ago. There seems to have been no clean inside since then, something had overgrown his mind, burrowed beneath his skin in a layer without feeling. I remembered...! Here it is:\n \n- In nomine Domini Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. There was something else, a word, a word, the last word. Too late. An inhuman howl followed like a faithful dog after her word:\n \n- With my sword I call all beings, intelligent and moon-guided, this day, in the first hour, keeping myself chaste three days before, with my hair free, dressed in white, with the voice of the Werewolf, in the place of execution, beyond human gaze, under heaven, on level ground, with names given me from my first birth!!! A wave of suffocation, gray dog heads, iron teeth, the smell of sweetness and oblivion. The end...\n \n \nA month earlier...", "He called her My angel, very accurately hitting the notes of the vibration with sounds, and even more aptly into her being. She did not resist. Who needs it – to break out of the commonality of his precisely limited world, to pull his strings before... . Let him act. Action strikes the process, the flow, the sound, the resonance, the beginning. Patry was annoyed by the names with which he imbued her with his essence, and as soon as she heard the proper names, her interest faded. Proper names have no history, their history has already been written by others, played out, only epithets await them. He would know her name afterwards, in time, and steel it in his flesh. She loved fear. As firmly as cigarettes. The thin haze of excitement, the power, the race, the nightly exhaust of passions, and fear rules it all. It's nice to know his fears. He called her an angel—protected from anything that might frighten him, and she was a child of his thought. Vice and flame framed that angel. What it spawned, it belongs, here, now, at night... The memory did not leave her, she fell asleep briefly to the sound of snow feathers that resembled her first wings.

But it was not the body that interested her...\n \n \nAmen! She finished the phrase she had begun. One of the men of her name, who had served her for centuries, held up a bowl to Patry. - Here is his mark, his symbol, his seal, his history. Patrie was somewhat distracted today. She didn't feel like making a decision:\n \n \n-Put it in the waters of Eternity. Never assign something to others if you can do it yourself. A new century, a new life. A beautiful stranger had taken up residence at eighty, Rue de Pinot, and she was like a heavenly angel. She had a cat in her service, a big, bright, half-dark cat. He nestled in her lap and never left again...\n \n \nWhere the heart is...\n \nShe searched for his soul. In the morning, first thing she felt whether he was a cat with a soul, in the daytime she fed him and took care of him – the cat, in the evening she had him as a pillow or a plaid – for her soul, and at night she became herself...and the cat ran away from home, not being able not to return.... The cat had no name. Although, he often made sounds similar to Andreas, but he's a cat, what else would you expect from a cat...? A few centuries earlier.", "Patri:\n \n \nI was wondering where my hair is? Silence. I remember... She stroked her bald head and dipped her hands into the water. There they are in the pool of the sewer pipe, all three million thin strings. Torn...? Gone. Water came out of the faucet, a drop at a time, squeezing the air out, she moaned. Red, dirty. It's hot. It's hot to breathe. Take it off! My futile attempts to peel the skin off at once might have succeeded. Instant transformation. Is this necessary? I had always suspected – they are fair and heartless. There, in the fragrance of the olive surf soothed, while unsuspecting spirits entered the grotto of «Acceptance,» their guides began their nocturnal summons. Male and female, thin and strong, confident hands wove a net a little farther, a little deeper, in the darkness, on the other side, where the stormy waters wash over the rocks. A language pleasing to me, familiar, scratched out of my memory, their voices sounded like an order to go. It seemed to be Farsi, sometimes there were Serbian words. Everyone was walking, and I was walking. In an instant, the grotto began to widen, the stones sounded too, the echoes groaned and brought me down with memories. The first of them was rebirth. The very first. Here in this tub, with the charred walls, the decrepit smell of the millions before me, and the only piece of furniture, a huge, carved mirror. He walked in on me perfectly savvy. His arsenal included the world's adverbs, knowledge, power, and even my gold-plated history, in a heavy folio, played against me. Loudly it sank to the tiles. Alisher:\n \n- Madness suits you, I wish I could pass it on to others. But they will become foolish and ignorant not knowing what to do with it? - You cannot know whether I am mad or alive. Only from the fact that you would be bored if you were me. Shall we celebrate the birth of faith? Here, in the tub? Total acceptance, and that's My choice of place and feeling. I am as crazy as you are blind. I went under the water with my head. Alisher looked at me through the thickness of the water with surprise, raised both hands up, which meant – I surrender. In half an hour I was standing in front of the mirror in my pristine form. Yes, black skin suits me better, glowing, wings growing at such a rate that I could hear the crunch of bones. She's marching! – the sound came from all sides, and I was shoved into the center of the cave. Small creatures sprang from the walls and ran, eager to see me in the flesh. One stepped on my tail and immediately, thanks to it, became a stain on the stone. The vile descendants of dragons, worthless, powerless, who signed the verdict of degeneration with their consent. Always watch what you sign, My irony preserves me. My incarnation, my history, my future, all decided here and now, though the higher ones had their own plans for me. It's nice to have a trump card up my sleeve. Oooh, that sweet feeling of Freedom for want of a better one. Every action of their doomsayers is preordained. Only the Creator has the right to ask me questions and get answers. Only he always decides! Never enter the same river twice. And I will go in, once, twice, a hundred times more, and come out clean! Of course the river is an idiotic name for a bath, which makes it even nicer. When choosing a dress for a new incarnation, I try not to go overboard with sexuality and depravity. Would a total sadist buy such a bitch? This one is angelically incomparable, immaculate, all so soft, white, almost said in creepy rosettes, blond, innocent-tender, Mine! I chose the first one, too. Let's start alphabetically this time. His name, his body, his soul cries out for power. From here you can see the cufflinks, the tie-pin, the gold-ring, the lash in his gaze. Isn't that an exhibit for the abyss? Patrie smoked a cigarette in a thin mouthpiece that materialized out of nowhere. Now up, into the arms, calling for a fight with the light!!! Ah, how amazing people are, they see only darkness in darkness, in Angel only an angel.... I know he will call me so – my angel. Delightful transformation, I rejoice like a child. I love it – Take it! Divide and Conquer! I'll divide his life into Before and After, into Love and Fear, someone has to do the dirty work. It's good to have your own in the ranks of the enemy.

On the horizon I see a billowing hurricane of political buzz words, cultural accusations, and inhumane testimonies tossing the sea, making huge waves across the dark depths. Each rotation of the massive word storm feeding on itself as it fights to stay in power, to stay relevant, to grow larger, and to wield more terror.”\n“Listen?” I ask?", "“All I do is listen.”\n“I hear the rolling thunder of protests because of racial injustice. I flinch as the clouds pour a deluge of tears from people being tossed in the sea of “progressive” speak. I brace as a tsunami of politicians’ lies feeds the giant wave as it crashes into a sleepy shore where unsuspecting people, just trying to get through their day, are convicted by the unforgiving tempest. Yes, I hear it all.”\nHe said, “No, I’m telling you to listen deeper.”\n“What do you want from me? I listen to podcasts telling me how evil the other side is. I hear the pundits point their accusations toward plain parents trying to make good decisions for their children. The shouts through my earphones from the professor laying blame at people based on melanin levels are deafening.”\n“I hear the sounds like the roaring rapids of the cash register at the grocery store ring haggardly as it reveals a higher number than last week’s higher number and the gas pump tick faster and faster as it figures the totals and the college administrators’ adding machine clickity clacking as it adds up the cost of an education. I hear the waves crashing against the dam I build around my daughter, desperately trying to keep her out of the storm long enough for her to grow and face it herself.”\n“Yes, I hear plenty.”\n“I hear people with complete lack of perspective, gliding above the ocean of words on a tip-proof yacht, pointing out from its decks at those fighting to keep their heads above the sea of words and telling them how they need to learn that they have oppressed people and that is why life has been harder for them.”\n “’You are the reason I felt uncomfortable in my time at the university!’ booms the man from the bough of his ship down to the middle-aged woman who once was considered middle class but is rapidly sinking down into the abyss of inflation and will soon count herself amongst the impoverished, who never had one bit of power over any other human being.” \n“And then, I hear her tiny voice back as she reaches up out of the bogs toward the man on the ocean liner, ‘But I never even knew you’ as her mouth fills with hateful words from social media, drowning her with accusations of misogyny, bigotry, and racism.” \n“Yes, I listen all the time.”\nHe said, “You only listen to what you are tuned into.", "Can you look out, beyond the stormy ocean and cling to a different message, one from peaceful, calm waters? Can you hear the silence that comes with contentment? Can you perk your ears to a different tune? I wince and reply, “I have heard about the quiet sea beyond the storm. I have searched for the calm myself, but no matter where in this world I look, I cannot find it. I listen for the peaceful, gentle roll of the waves from a quieted ocean, but the storm is too loud and big. I can’t keep my head above the crashing waves of disappointment.”\n“You cannot find that peace in this world. If you rely only on your fellow man, peace will always elude you.", "Look further out, further still. Do you see the sun on the horizon? Can you hear the voices quieting? Can you feel your body relax, your mind dance with hope, your heartbeat slowing, your soul stirring? Listen for the quiet. Listen.”\nMy mind searches beyond the storm. I close my eyes and strain to hear the silence in all of the swirl of words around me.", "I ignore the social media posts blowing in like a Nor’easter and I suppress the hurricane of lies from politicians trying to scare me into giving them more control. I disregard the whirlpool of elitists separating us all by race and gender and victimhood. And there, just beyond all the cacophony of the storm, I hear it...peace. “There’s a small hum, what is that?”\n “Listen harder,” He says. “Is that singing?” Yes, yes. I can just make it out. There’s a swelling of it now, of many voices who have swum beyond the storm-tossed seas to...to what? To peace? I close my eyes now and keep swimming toward the joyful sound of voices singing. I begin to make out the words. But just as I am catching the chorus, crash, goes the thunder and swoosh goes the wind and for a moment, I lose the melody. “Focus now, keep listening.”\n“It’s so hard. I’ve lost my direction again.", "I can’t make out the singing now.” Another nor’easter blows in as we go through another political cycle and another waterfall of words into the dark, tossed seas, this time it’s the doctor giving me bad news and a family member in pain. Friends on social media ridicule in another tsunami of insults. I just can’t seem to...\n“I am right here. You’re closer than you think. Close your eyes, now, and follow my voice.”\nAnd then I hear Him. I hear the singing again.", "Oh, yes, I hear them all! I look out beyond the storm and the new gathering clouds and I see, again, the hazy sun on the horizon. And I see them, a giant raft with people on it singing. What is it that...oh, I can...Oh, I join in...\n“it is well, with my soul, it is well, it is well, with my soul.”\nNow I hear it loud and clear, all the beautiful notes from those who have a deep understanding of what they are singing. I swim harder toward the raft as if the storm were chasing me, because it is. I look back one more time and begin to sink when the lightning tears the sky and illuminates the enormity of the storm and the towering waves of the dark abyss. “Don’t look back,” he says. “Keep listening for Me.”\nI turn my head back toward the hazy sun and pull away from the storm that reaches for my ankles in a last-ditch effort to control me, to pull me back into the gulf. I begin to feel the sun on my face and the waters calm beneath me.", "I reach to my face to wipe away the sea spray and then realize they are my own tears. “When did I start crying?” \nI’m compelled forward with such determination to reach the raft and join the other survivors of the never-ending storm. Now I’m close enough to realize that the light isn’t the sun at all, but a glow from the Man who told me how to find Him. He stands there, shining like a lighthouse on a rocky shore; a solid fortress in a storm. “Now, you can hear me,” he said, smiling, seeming to be as happy to see me as I was to see Him. “Yes.", "I can hear every word now,” I cry, realizing that the storm doesn’t just sound far away now, but nonexistent. I turn once more to see the storm behind me. I realize that from this angle, the storm is somehow miniscule. I see the desperate people fighting for air as they are tossed and thrown about the waves. I see the looks on their faces as they look ahead to see another whirlpool before them and another wall of water behind them. I see the panic as they struggle to pull themselves above the surface, and I wonder why I didn’t grab more of them on my way toward the Peace? “They have to find their own way through the storm, but I am with them,” and then He whispers in my ear, “just as I was there with you.”"], "summaries": ["A character is overwhelmed by a storm of words, struggling to make sense of the chaos around them.

I am reminded of that tire swing every time I walk into this room!\" \"Don't forget the kisses; we did that a lot too!\" she reminded him. \"How can I forget?\" he boldly brushed back her hair with his hand. Lisa stood up from the table, \"Why are you here?", "Do you need anything? How can I help you?\" Gary lowered his head and closed his eyes. He had thought about what he would say to her since he was recovering in ICU. \"Lisa, I had experienced so much pain these last few years. I had lost my mother, my wife left me, lost a job that I absolutely loved, and then this lung cancer arrived. I was within minutes of dying several times. But, dying was not as painful as the divorce or losing my mother or my job.\" Lisa returned to the examination table and placed an arm around his shoulder. He paused, lifted his head, and looked into her eyes. A breath of fresh air filled his lung. \"I realized during that moment that I might not wake up again. I thanked God for this life. I told him I loved him, and I was ready if he needed to take me.\" Gary grabbed Lisa's hands.", "\"I'm not sure when I woke up, but I did! My mind raced!\" He squeezed her hands. \"I have so much to do, I thought! And then I thought of you. Like I seem to do throughout the different phases of my life. I always return to you.\" Lisa let out a deep breath, \"Awe, Gary.\" \"I wanted to return home, and I wanted to tell you, after all these years, how much you have meant to me and how much I miss you.\" Gary paused for a moment. Lisa's hazel eyes sparkled with delight from his confession. She smiled and tried to speak but only could laugh hysterically. Gary leaned towards her, and Lisa stopped laughing. He placed his arms around her waist, and she put her hands around his neck. Gary pulled the clip from Dr. Melton's hair. \"I think you are even more beautiful than when we were young and reckless.\" He pressed his lips against hers. At first, it was short, wet kisses, but soon they held each other tightly and kissed passionately until they were forced to breathe warm, intimate breaths into each other's mouths. Gary stopped. They were breathing heavily. \"Wait!\" He pulled her away but held onto her arms. Then, he leaned in, \"Are you married?\"", "She released herself from his grip, laughed loudly, and punched him in the arm again. \"What? No? Oh my God! You brat!\" He placed his arms around her again. They began to sway back and forth. Soon they were kissing again. Gary was overwhelmed with how attractive she made him feel. He reached for her lab coat and started to tear at the buttons. Lisa reached for his shirt and pulled it over his head. A loud tap could be heard at the door, followed by the nurse entering the room.", "Gary's shirt was still on his head with his arms raised upwards. He dropped Dr. Melton's hair clip to the floor. The young nurse giggled at the two of them. \"Right on, Dr. Melton. I see you're trying your new therapy protocol on this patient.\" She laughed again and left the room. Gary looked at Lisa. Her face was completely flushed. \"New therapy protocol? Has she seen this method before?\" Lisa leaned over and laughed. Gary rubbed her back. She moved away from him, laid down on the examination table, and covered her eyes. Dr. Melton couldn't stop laughing. \"Actually, Gary,\" she shook her head and continued to laugh, \"she has!\""], "summaries": ["Gary, filled with nostalgia, encounters a painting that triggers memories of his childhood home, leading him to a mysterious reunion.", "Gary, who just finished treatment for stage 4 lung cancer, reunites with his former lover, Lisa, who is also his dad's doctor.

Jun turned his head away from the side where he had been flirting with a girl and looked at his friend.“What?” Jun asked. “Are you really okay to come on this trip with me? I mean - closing your restaurant and everything?” Namjun clarified quietly as he glanced down at his feet before looking up again to his friend's eyes that were shining with a look of seriousness that Namjun rarely ever saw. Jun’s next words seemed to contradict his eyes but Namjun knew that Jun was sincerely doing this for him.“You ARE paying for the food, right?”Namjun sighed as he shook his head with a slight smile on his face. He wiped the smile off of his face and looked into Jun’s eyes again. “YES, I’m paying for the food! Still!”“Then, YES, I’m okay with coming on this trip with you!” Jun laughed his signature, high-pitched laugh while clapping his hands after saying that. “Seriously though, you need some rest. If you sleep for the rest of the ride then you might get enough beauty sleep to be a solid eight. Of course, I’m a ten but beating my handsome face was never an option anyway.” Jun laughed again as he stood up.“Where are you going?”“I’m going to make some conversation with that lovely lady over there,” Jun said as his eyes shifted and made eye contact with the girl while he finished his sentence. The girl giggled and turned her head to hide her blush. “Get some sleep! Maybe I’ll teach you the true art of being handsome when you wake up!” Jun left the room and headed into the crowded train to say hi to the girl in the room across from them.", ". . .Namjun woke up to see that he was still alone in the train car. It was dark outside and he could see the bright stars in the cloudless sky. He lightly smiled. He was happy to have this short break. He barely managed to get this break for himself and he really was excited about it. He had been through a lot these past few months. Becoming rich out of nowhere, Becoming president of an entire country, marrying a girl he barely knew who hated him, having scandals and misunderstandings with his wife, losing his wife, losing his virginity, and more things in between. Despite all of the struggles, he felt peaceful at that moment. He stared at the sky and just explained it inside his head to the best of his ability so he’d remember it better. “Dark, indigo sky. Empty of clouds or other impurities. Dotted with the freckles of the universe. Dimly lit with little lanterns that we call stars. What a beauty. Planets, stars, and the sky. Such simple things but so wonderful and breathtaking. I hope that someday I can find my moon. The person who lights up my life and steals all of my attention. Lit up on its own and lighting the way for others. What a majestic wonder.”Namjun drifted off to sleep again thinking about all the plans he had to turn his life right-side-up again. . . .“Rise and shine koala!", "We’re here!” Namjun slowly blinked his eyes open and squinted them as the bright lights on the ceiling hit them. He let his eyes adjust and they quickly found their way to Jun who was standing right in front of Namjun. Jun grabbed Namjun’s arm and pulled him off of the train seat. Namjun wobbled on his feet for a moment before gaining his balance back and really waking up. Jun grabbed his friend's hand and led him off of the train with their bags. “I already called the driver and he should be here!” Jun said as he stood with Namjun at the station and looked around. His eyes stopped on someone and grew bigger. “Jungguk and Taehyun? What are you two doing here?”Namjun turned his head and trained his eyes on his two friends who stood by a small car and waved. “I’m your driver! Didn’t you recognize my voice! ?” Jungguk yelled as he waved them over. The two older men headed over to the two youngsters. “I didn’t really think about it. I thought it was a little weird and then I ignored it!” Jun said and he gently pushed Namjun into the backseat of the car and closed the door. Jun walked around to the other side and hopped in himself. Jungguk started driving and spoke to Jun while occasionally glancing into the rearview mirror. “Namjun just wanted a quiet break and we figured that it wouldn’t be a real break unless you had some friends over, right! ?”“Do you even know what a break is?” Namjun grumbled as he rubbed his eyes. “That’s what I said.” A groggy voice spoke from the trunk. Namjun turned and looked into the backseat to find a bigger surprise than his first friends.“What in the world are you guys all doing here?” Namjun asked as Jaemin sat up. Doseok tried to sit up but was pushed back down by Yoon-Ki who was laying his head on Doseok’s stomach. Doseok sighed and put his hands under his head so he could see Namjun and Jun better (Jun had also peeked his head over the couch after Namjun spoke). “According to these idiots, a break is where all of your friends come to invade your personal space and never leave your side,” Yoon-Ki spoke again. His eyes were closed and he made no movements to get up from Doseoks stomach. “Just think of us as your emotional support animals!” Taehyun chimed in helpfully. “Can we be serious for a second? Guys?” Namjun asked as he sat facing the car window so that he could look at all of the boys at the same time. “Why are you guys all here? Jin, you have a restaurant to take care of! Yoongi, you have a wife and a new baby to take care of! Doseok, you have music to make and records to break! Jaemin, you have a wife at home and if you don’t already have a baby on the way then you should be getting to that! Taehyun, you must have some movie filming to do or something else! Jungguk, you have modeling jobs and girls to woo! What are you guys all doing with me when there are more important things to do! ?” The car was silent for a moment as all of the boys avoided eye contact. After a long silence, Jun, who was right in front of Namjun at the moment, spoke.“Listen, My restaurant is not more important than you. Yoongi’s wife and baby are in a stable condition for the time being and Artemis is staying with them. Doseok's work can wait a week. Jaemin’s wife can wait a week. Taehyung and Jungguk's work can wait a while too. It’s just a week and we’ll always have time for you when you need it. You’re not one to ask for help but you should know that you can. We’re all here for you. Let us help you.”The drive was silent for the rest of the ride as the boys all let Namjun think about what Jun had said. . . .The boys had arrived and all gone in to unpack their stuff.", "They took Namjun’s things and told him not to worry and to just look around the property. It was a warm beach. Namjun had just started walking and he took this time to think back about what each of his friends had said later during the ride.“As much as I hate to admit this, you’ve helped me a lot more than any normal friend would help someone. Especially an asshole like me. I’m the worst friend there is and you still find time to help me and talk with me. I know I don’t express it a lot because it’s embarrassing for me so I hope you remember this because it won’t be happening again. Even though I don’t seem like it, if you genuinely need help, I’ll help you. You don’t even have to ask, I’m there.” Yoon-Ki had said. He’d kept his eyes closed the entire time, still laying on Doseoks stomach but Namjun could feel the sincerity. Yoon-Ki really wasn’t the sentimental type so Namjoon was thankful for his words of kindness.“You are one of the most important people to me in the whole entire world. You’re in the top ... six! I know that I’m busy a LOT but I’m never too busy for you! You’ll always be my favorite know-it-all! I admire your strength but strength isn’t everything. Sometimes, you just need a friend. It doesn’t matter how long you need, I’ve got all the time in the world for you. Sincerely, I love you, bro! And you know I’m not lying because I can’t lie!” The whole friend group had laughed at Doseok's words before Jaemin clapped and told everyone to quiet down so he could talk.“I’m just gonna be straightforward about this. You lost an important piece of your life. Your wife. I can’t imagine losing the love of my life. It must be painful for you and lonely too. One thing I can’t stand is being alone so I always have a snuggle buddy around! You’ve been an awesome snuggle buddy whenever you’re around me so I hope we can snuggle more often. I’ve got all the time in the world too! Who needs Artemis when I can have you as a snuggle buddy! ?” Again, the friends laughed.“Me me! Me too!” Taehyun had said quietly. The car quieted to hear what the sweet boy had to say. “We’re all connected! All of us! When you’re hurt, we’re hurt! In my world, there wouldn’t be any problems but I can’t take you to my world so I’ll take pieces of my world to you! Whenever you’re hurt, I’ll bring a little piece of joy from my world to make you forget the pain! Whenever you’re tired, I’ll bring a pillow from my world! When you’re sad, I’ll bring a little sunshine and I’ll always bring the boys too! You guys can all have pieces of my world whenever you want! Even when you’re happy!” The group of friends laughed at Tae’s pure words and the youngest friend spoke his own words of wisdom.“Like Taehyun said earlier, we’re your support animals! You can lean on us! We always have time and comfort just waiting for you! We’ll stop in an instant with whatever we’re doing just to help you because you are our priority! You don’t deserve any pain! I’ve never had a *Hyung more amazing than you! Please use me! Use us! Use us and our love to lessen your pain. If pain was a person then I’d just fight him for you but, since he isn’t, I’ll just do the best I can to pull him off of you! Metaphorically speaking, of course!” Again, the whole group laughed. They all had said their pieces and hoped Namjun would really think about it. (*Older brother/not always used for older brothers.", "Can be used for close guy friends as well) Namjun found a spot to sit on the beach after all of that walking. The sun was setting and he wanted to be able to watch it set. Only a few minutes after Namjun had sat down in the warm sand, he felt the presence of a group and soon noticed his friends sitting next to him. They stayed silent. Just their presence was enough to make him feel at peace. He lightly smiled and leaned his head against Yoon-Ki’s shoulder. To his surprise, Yoon-Ki made no attempt to push him away so they stayed like that as all the friends watched the sunset. Once more, Namjun looked at the sky and explained it to the best of his ability in his mind so he wouldn’t forget it.Orange, yellow, pink, blue and other colors! So colorful. The wonderful shining ball of light in the center of the sky! The few clouds drifting away to find their own beds for the night. Warm, gentle breeze. Little crabs and turtles walking along the beach. Seashells in the yellow-orange sand. Most importantly, the six most important people in my life. My best friends. I don’t know WHAT in the world I’d do without them. Actually .... I do. I’m confident that I would have no place in this world if it weren’t for them! I’m grateful that they came with me on this trip! I can’t wait to see what these wonderful idiots have planned next!"], "summaries": ["Namjun's friend, Jun, decides to go on a trip with him despite closing his restaurant, showing true friendship.

New People’s Army communist rebels rustled through the green woods and came in for rice and blue LP tanks for their generators. My father, the first time, was asked if he was going for the drugs or the girls. The man on the jeepney was eager to sell him both. I wasn’t afraid of it. The rebels claimed to be for the poor. It wasn’t logical for the rebels to harm my family. It wouldn’t have fit their propaganda to stop the free blood sugar testing. If it had been the Abu Sayyaf, then I would be frightened. The friend of our friend lost her husband to them the year our family moved to the Philippines. There had been a lot of tongues wagging, questions about my parents’ sanity. Besides, wasn’t the Philippines a Christian country? Why did they need missionaries? That was before the shooting in Colorado proved that American and familiar didn’t guarantee safety. The safest place was in the center of God’s will. Besides, the Abu Sayyaf were in Mindanao, a different island, waves apart. This was Mountain Province, where people nodded and said “Good morning,” as you walked by and asked where you were going. The dark whispers added a sense of adventure, made the story better for retelling. It was like the long swinging bridge at Anabel, I thought. My sisters and I bounced on it, while the foreigners and the Lowlanders stared too long through the holes of the recycled World War II metal runway at the whirling river below. I leaned into Ate Mindel Ing-Inga (a respectful term meaning “big sister”) as the red and yellow jeepney lurched up the mountain towards it.", "Ate Mindel’s husband, Pastor Steve, sat up top on the luggage rack with sacks of rice, blue gas tanks, a basket of chickens, and the spare tire. Their daughter, Stevonnie Bless, slept against her mother, tucked in a sarong. We made it without changing tires, landslides, or slipping down the mountain. Already, it was going better than last time. Less exciting, but much easier. Despite the dark whispers, the village was mundane.", "A long way up the mountain, with a path half-paved, part red mud, part gravel that slipped under your feet, but ordinary. Close houses of grey concrete, chickens pecking around. There was no weaving, like Can-eo or Sagada. No giant swinging bridge. Perhaps, a few more wooden houses than normal. Still, I felt the thrilling pressure of adulthood as we walked through the village, stepping over knee-height fences. (Saclit didn’t have pigpens.) It was my first trip by myself. Well, without my family. Her my adult trip. The Ing-Ingas were close family friends. But Ate Mindel was careful to call me “lady”, especially after my 15th birthday. And it was me who was chosen. Not my parents. Not my sisters who were always the first to grab babies and very reluctant to share. I had expected it to be my sister who was always mistaken as the eldest. She was taller, beautiful, graceful, responsible, the one the rest of my sisters followed. But they had chosen me as the godparent of their daughter. The Inga-Ingas stopped to chat with people and remind them of the dedication service. I smiled and listened. I didn’t know much, just a little Ilocano, and that didn’t help much. Ilocano was a trade language. Here in their home, people spoke their own dialect. One word I knew, “Americano,” I was always hearing it. At the parsonage below the church, I held and sang to Stevonne while Ate Mindel prepared a meal of rice and a donated squash.", "The parsonage was small, two rooms and a storage room of vitamin rice donated for the Odong and Peping landslides. No bathroom or “comfort room” though. In the day, the Ing-Ingas went to their neighbor’s house. She was a nice, wrinkled woman who didn’t speak any English and her bathroom had no door, just a short curtain at the side of the stairs. At night, they went outside under the stars. As they cleaned up, Ate Mindel said, “And let’s pray the rats don’t bite us while we’re sleeping.”\tPastor Steve slept upstairs on one of the wooden pews.", "Ate Mindel unrolled a mat with pinch-thick white foam and a shiny foil side. My father called them “space blankets.” I lay my glasses and flashlight by my head. She turned off the light. I tried to sleep but I kept listening. I could hear them, the scritch-scratching, clicking of many toenails on wood. Ate Mindel was not one to joke. Stay still, I thought. Ignore. It was closer now. Ate Mindel was sleeping. I did not want to wake her, like a frightened child. I was an adult now. I could handle it. Never mind my gratitude when Pastor Steve prevented me from decorating the church when the drunk man arrived. Never mind that the last time I was in Saclit, I had shared a room with my father since my room had gongs with the traditional jawbone handles and I was sure they weren’t pig. My former hosts had offered for me stay with them again but I had chosen rats over bones and I didn’t want to leave the Ing-Ingas. I could do this. The sounds increased. I wasn’t going to sleep like this. I had to see it. Just turn on the flashlight and I could see it, maybe scare it away. I couldn’t find the flashlight. Ate Mindel woke up to my rustling and found it. It was just a moth in a cellophane bag. There was a scream in the night.", "A rat fell off the church. Pastor Steve yelled and threw his flip-flop at another one. The morning of the dedication was beautiful with sunshine and the sound of women pounding rice.", "Ate Mindel whitened her face with baby powder. I was able to find an outhouse for a cold dipper bath. It was that morning that Ate Mindel told me that rats only bite if they smell food and not if you washed your hands. The dedication was solemn. The visiting pastor asked if the godparents would help the parents nurture their child, physically, mentally, and spiritually? Whether we were willing to take this vow before the congregation? Ate Mindel translated. She was one of the few who remembered. The weight and warmth of Stevonnie overwhelmed me. I prayed for health, pictured it flowing from my hands like streams of light. I longed that she would lead a bright life, full of joy, strong, and able to make others smile like the song you hum on a beautiful morning. As required for a Filipino celebration, there was a feast of rice, pancit noodles, and sticky rice. I was given a mountain of sticky rice and was struggling to eat it all and plotting a way to sneak the excess to chickens or stray dogs so I didn’t offend by not finishing it. Ate Mindel told me it was ok.\tWe missed the jeepney back.", "I always missed the jeepney back from Saclit. I also always fell on the gravel path down to the highway, with more shame than pain, no matter how I watched my feet or walked sideways. We flagged down a blue survey van. It went forward a little, then back a little, then forward a little more. Pastor Steve was frantic that my parents would worry. I wasn’t, I knew my parents trusted him. Pastor Steve was so worried, he leapt out of the van to try to hitchhike on an apparently empty ambulance. He tangled his foot in the seatbelt and was close to needing the ambulance himself. The ambulance was not empty. It went on. The van also went on, forward a little, back. We finally caught a bus safe back home to Bontoc. My adventure was over. I had survived. No rat bites. And now I was a little less afraid of growing up. It would happen. And I had to do it well. I had a little one to take care of."], "summaries": ["In the village of Saclit, a border town between Kalinga and Mountain Province, the presence of communist rebels adds an element of danger and intrigue, raising questions about safety and family in the midst of unfamiliar surroundings.", "Ate Mindel and her family successfully navigate a journey with fewer obstacles this time, finding the village surprisingly uneventful.", "A young girl embarks on her first solo trip to a village, where she is unexpectedly chosen as the godparent of her close family friends' daughter.

Everything was fabricated by that snake, and this is the evidence.” She handed him a USB and said: “You must go back to your woman and your child. \"He watched what it contained and felt shocked and heartbroken, he went to Jessica and scolded her , Jessica tried to prevent him from going and justify herself that She loved him first, and couldn't stand the idea that staying them together, but he did not respond to her, determined to retrieve his wife no matter what happens.The next day, Rosalia went with her mother to the family gathering, met her relatives and greeted them.", "In the evening at 8:00pm, they all gathered around the great-grandmother. She wanted to tell them the story of the family legend. She spoke: “It began with spirits called “Silla.” These spirits were forcing the people of the village to sacrifice children at the age of 10, and when the choice fell on the family of a little girl named “Evelyn” , who is one of our family's grandmothers. The people of the village tried to sacrifice her despite her family's refusal, so they kidnapped her and sat her on the ground in front of the fire in chains. The spirits ordered her to jump into the fire for them. Evelyn told them that she would never jump, so she cleverly ran away from them because of what her mother had taught her and she sealed them in a leather book called \"Quiet Hustle.\" \" So they swore that they would find her in this life or another and take revenge on anyone whose blood bond with her , they would take his life from him when the fifteenth moon was full, so be careful, my dear.\" Rosalia's phone was ringing for a few minutes, and the caller was Victor, and before the ringing was cut off.", "She answered him subconsciously, he said: \"Rosa, please don't shut up and listen to what I have.\" She sighed: \"Okay, I can hear you.\" He told her the beginning of what happened with Jessica to his conversation with Lily and the USB was shocked by his talk.He tells her how much he loves her and how much he wants them to be a happy family. She started crying, she said in a hoarse voice:” My soul misses you I want to be with you forever with our child.”’answer her with love and desire :“Me too, my rose my beautiful girl.”In the end, they reconciled, and she gave him the address of the family's house.After they had eaten dinner all went to sleep, and when it was midnight in Rosalia's room, watching the moon through the window and smiling with her hand on her stomach, she said, \"Finally, we will be family again.\" Suddenly, a child's voice comes out from nowhere . She turned behind her to see her standing at the open door step of the room. The girl tried to speak, but only the roar of the wind came out of her mouth. Rosalia's body shivered when the little girl ran away.She went down the stairs and saw a person's shadow from afar inside the room that had been hermetically locked for years. She approached until she arrived in front of the door. No, there are two people, one of them is a woman reading an old leather book, and the other looks like a woman's body, but her head was missing. The one who had the book in her hand spoke frighteningly: \"Our birthday present is your progeny, Evelyn.\" Rosa was pulled into the room and closed tightly.And her heartbreaking screams, which woke them up in fright, they rushed to look for her. Then the grandmother came out of her room with sadness on her face, and she said: They took her.Meanwhile Victor entered the house when one of the servants had opened the door for him and found them gathered, and when he saw Rosa's father he spoke with joy: Uncle, aunt, where is Rosa?", "I have good news, Rosa and I reconcile, and she is pregnant with our child.Everyone in the room froze and her mother faints. He collapsed after they told him that she had been killed by the evil spirits of Silla.Rosalia woke up in an abandoned house, the feeling that she did not remember why she was there, it was frightening. She noticed how quiet it was . The walls, furniture, and paintings had appeared as old as time. she heard the sound of an old typewriter as she walked around the room, something was looking strangely familiar.She made her way through the house, and suddenly an old woman appeared in front of her, the old woman whispered words that Rosalia could not understand. Rosalia tried to ask her: \"Who are you?\" But the old woman whispered something else in the same language, but it made her uncomfortable. Then she took a step back, and then shadows appeared around her that moved like a flame of fire. The old woman began to cheer and things began to fly toward her - statues with sharp edges, chairs with nails protruding from them, even knives that came out of nowhere.As soon as Rosalia saw all this happening around her, she ran for her life before anything else came, almost stumbling on something, while it turned out to be a strangely shaped book of black leather with silver inscriptions that she could not read. It was written in a strange language but her name is on it.She headed toward one of the rooms, after making sure that it was free of anything strange, and sat on a sofa that was in front of the fireplace, with two sofas on her right and left, and in front of her was a wide tea table with a vase in the middle of it with a red flower.", "Rosalia sighed and spoke to herself in a loud voice: \"Oh my God, how can this be? I don't know how I got here and how to get out of this abandoned house.\" Then she put her hand on her stomach and said: \"My child, I apologize for this mess. I hope you are fine, what a curious fool I am !! .\" She couldn't remember how she got there or why she was there in the first place. She reached out to grab the book but when her fingers were about to grab it, the book turned into an owl and flew away.She tried to follow the owl , but then she saw that there were two identical rooms that looked exactly like this room she was in now. The owl entered one of them, and when she entered behind it, the owl came out through another door. She followed the owl again into the other room ,where she saw herself sitting with another girl on the sofa almost like mirrors, reading a book.Suddenly this sight disappeared and a beautiful middle-aged woman with an eagle tattoo appeared in front of her. She spoke and said: \"Rosalia, my granddaughter, thank you for accepting my invitation, and thank God for escaping these rotten souls.\" Rosalia calmly stepped back and spoke: \"Who are you?\" the Woman: \"I'm Evelyn. \"Rosalia with a misunderstanding: \"Am i your granddaughter?!! Wait, are you Evelyn that Grandma told about before I came here, how young are you!! \"Evelyn with a smile:\"I think I have to explain to you what happened and what will happen. \"Evelyn told her the story she had heard before, but what she hadn't heard from the story was that Evelyn didn't lock them up forever, and it wasn't her, It was Rosalia who was destined to finish them off.Rosalia: \"No, wait ,I just saw this woman speaking in a strange language. I can't understand it, but she seems to know what she's doing because she pushed me into the hallway and somehow locked the door so I couldn't leave. \"Evelyn: \"That is not the problem, You are going to have to face them by read the book\"Rosalia: \"But how is this possible? I can't read it ! \"Evelyn: \"Open the book and read it see it now\"She browsed the book, and the sound of the wind blowing through the trees, the rustle of leaves, and the rain of the book rose and soon disappeared. Suddenly, the words had changed into a language she could understand across the pages faster than she could read with her eyes at once before stopping suddenly, the words on the pages began to light up as if they were on fire.Evelyn smiled proudly at her when Rosalia looked at her in anticipation.", "Evelyn said, \"It seems that there is some kind of ritual for five people, now only four people are needed. \"Rosalia asked Evelyn, \"There's no one here but you and me. We need three more people. \"\"Try to bring the people closest to your heart,\" said Evelyn, but Rosalia's head was completely blank. \"She doesn't remember\" - those words echoed in her head. It was a dull, painful feeling that gripped her mind and soul. It was a feeling she couldn't fully comprehend, an idea I ran away from as soon as I tried to think about it whispered. : \"Mom, Dad, Victor.\" While she was looking around, she heard a voice calling: “Rosa, my flower, where are you?” Rosalia’s heart beat strongly: “Victor, where are you? !” Suddenly the door broke and her parents appeared behind him and Victor hugged them.She explained to them everything that was going on, Evelyn asked Rosalia's parents for help and to stop this heavy legacy.They agreed and began performing the ritual to kill the evil spirits. Evelyn explained to them that it would take several days to complete the ritual, but the longer they waited, the more dangerous it became.Two days later, Rosalia woke up feeling confused and ill, her mind becoming foggy and a new, stronger force was growing within her over the time of her stay.", "She can feel somehow connected to this black book and everything that has happened to her since she opened it yesterdayEvelyn said : \"The ritual is almost done, you have to hurry and read the book, but make sure that you do the rituals as they're written in the book before you read the book.”\"What about my parents and Victor, where are they?\" said Rosalia. \"They're back,\" said Evelyn. \"They are waiting for you on the other side . We must hurry. \"When she was in front of the book, she felt like she was falling into it. She was seeing things differently, she was seeing different worlds, different realities, like she was traveling through time and space. The book was glowing with a mysterious energy that made Rosalia's hair stand on end.Suddenly, she was in a white room, with a black man who seemed familiar standing beside a woman holding a baby, both looking like reflections of each other, and a strange book was on top of a table. She advanced towards the black book, knowing that it was that book \"Quiet Hustle. \", closed her eyes and muttered some words, and a silver dagger came out of the book with her name engraved on it.She grabbed the dagger in both hands and shouted out, :\"It is time for the clamor to be quiet forever ,Silla spirits ,In my name I am Evelyn's fifteenth granddaughter Rosalia, I will erase you forever\" Then she stabbed the book.When the ritual was complete ,Evelyn said, \"You are free from the Silla spirit. \"Congratulations, Rosalia, you are the only one of us that succeeded in the ritual. \"Then she gave her the dagger as an inheritance gift .Rosalia: \"Thank you, Evelyn, I promise to be a good mother and a good person, and I want to be a good mother for my child.”Evelyn: \"I'm happy to have known you. Now go and live the rest of your life with Victor, with love in your hearts for the child that is to come from them.” The door opened and a white light filled the room. Rosalia's parents were standing there with tears in their eyes. Waiting for their daughter , Victor was worried about his wife Rosalia and the child in her womb.Rosalia came out the door and hugged her parents, Victor hugged her and said, \"I will never let you out of my sight again. \"Then the family returned home.Eight years later , with his healthy and intelligent child playing on the beach he heard a soft voice say: “Victor darling come inside with Lucian” ,Victor: “We are coming honey” , \" we must go before the Silla spirits come.", "\"Their laughter grew louder as they ran inside, and they lived happily ever after.The End"], "summaries": ["Rosalia contemplates divorce from Victor, despite their once-solid love, as her mother implores her to reconsider.

He rubbed them and his dry eyes began to water. He'd had the same dream again. His room was dark. Suddenly the world illuminated into life with light. His mother had opened the window and was standing smiling, looking; looking at him.Julian's heart fluttered with unfamiliarity. \"Did I wake you? I didn't think you could hear me,\" she said, her smile faltering with a strain. Julian noticed how it didn't completely reach up to her eyes. Julian didn't respond. He closed his eyes again. Slowly, his mother inched towards him. Julian could feel her warmth, that rippling sense of relaxation and comfort. Her hand must've been really close to him now, he could smell the pancakes she'd made for his brothers and sisters. He could feel the tender touch of her palm. The way her warm skin always seemed cold against his. Ice cold because she didn't want them there. Julian rolled over and put the blanket over him, chancing a glance at his mom. He saw her flinch with sadness as a veil of darkness covered him. \"I'll bring you some coffee,\" his mother said, her voice muffled through the blanket. She left, closing the door as slow she could. Julian could tell her hand was shaking around the knob. He wondered if he would hear these subtle things if he didn't look out for them every time he did anything.", "Every time his mind wandered to the thoughts he never vocalized, as they hit his stomach like stinging hot iron and coiled around his insides. He really didn't want the coffee. ****Julian looked dreamily out the window; his hands against the pot of coffee his mother always seemed to bring him for cold winter mornings. How could he tell her it didn't make him feel warm? Ever? Julian looked out the slowly frosting glass window and saw his city bloom into view. His pale pupils shook from the intensity of light outside. Even though the clouds bleached the sky and sunlight; his eyes needed accustoming to the smallest amount. London meant a lot of things to lot of people. London should've been just another city, but to Julian it was so much more. London was beautiful; beautiful like the only place he'd even known. The serene skies filled with soft puffs of clouds. The gorgeous trees slumping with the burden of saying goodbye to the leaves that held onto them for three seasons. Sometimes Julian threw the window open and stood by the edge letting the city breeze sweep by, caressing his hair and flirting with his eyelids, sending thrills of cold through his lashes where they tenderly lost themselves is his big dark eyes as he opened them and life bustled into view. London was never a quiet city. Not even at night; Julian would know as he never slept. He couldn't sleep; slowly crying in pain for all of his torments. That's why Julian cherished mornings. They made him feel cozy; at peace. So, he pushed his thoughts of the night away and his stomach lurched in pain. Julian smiled bitterly. \"Mimo?\"", "a girl with short blonde hair walked in his room, her gaze uncertain and playful like always. She had big blue eyes which were looking at Julian as if he was an aquarium full of wonders. Julian winced. He bent down and ruffled his sister's hair.\"Mimo?\" he repeated; straining to smiling. His sister didn't notice. \"MIMO!\" she screamed; her mouth now wide open in innocent joy. \"I'm Julian. Lila, you're not learning your names properly. Isn't Chresti teaching you well?\" Julian spoke, playfully stern.The little girl pouted, \"But you have big black eyes,\" she said slowly caressing his hair, Julian's gut wretched inwards, \"Like that one fish from 'Mimo'\" she said, her eyes flaring with happiness. Julian guessed he could have this one moment. Just one. ''Its Nem-\" Julian began but he was interrupted. \"Mom's sad about you.\" she spoke, more as if she was being told to than she wanted to. Julian's heart gripped with a sharp anger. How could they use her? How could they already make her hate- \"She's sad Mimo. \"Julian broke. He threw his pot of coffee on the ground with tremendous force, as it spilled all through the sprawled books, newspapers and articles he'd always collected but never bothered to clean. His favorite dragon toy was soaked with the brown liquid. So was every toy he'd sprawled around his room, never bothering to clean. Never letting anyone else do it either. \"JULIAN-\" his mother burst into the room, her face contorted in fear and pity, her hair wasn't tied and flew about frantically. Her eyes darted to the room and she saw the spill. She looked back at Julian with sad eyes. Somehow, her eyes, the emotion behind them, made Julian more annoyed. \"Get out mom! And take Lila with you! I don't want your coffee! I don't want any of it!\" Julian screamed back at her. She smiled at him. Julian couldn't believe her gall. \"Did you have a nightmare? You should've called me, I would've slept with you,\" she continued, slowly advancing towards him. Her eyes tearing and contorted. They looked a lot like Julian's when he'd been talking to Lila. Julian couldn't bear it. Her black eyes that darted back into his like a bullet searing his skin. Julian ran for his bed. Lila started crying. \"I don't need you! I don't need your help!\" he shouted to her; his words as cold as ice. His mother flinched again as he drew his blanket over him. He blocked out everything, his ears, his eyes and his heart. Lila kept crying.", "After a while, Julian heard a door close and the crying muffled.But still, Lila had cried. ****\"Don't look down, out into nothing. Don't look down, searching for something.\" Julian looked into his soup bowl staring at the flakes of chicken float by. There was too much salt Julian had thought, although he'd never mention that to his mother. No talking around the dinner table. Nor did he want to. \"Hey Jules, pass me that bowl,\" Chresti, his oldest sister poked him as he picked up the bowl and gave it to her. She was nearer to it than he was. Julian scowled at how odd she was. She gave him a half smile.Julian's two other brothers, and his three other sisters sat around the table all flinging food at each other. Lila was laughing until she cried out of laughter. Cried. The words parched Julian's tongue. She was innocent. She did nothing. His father was late to meals again, as always working in the factory. Julian liked his father; liked him in the way he never got to talk to him much so he didn't have reason to be afraid of him. Julian looked sideways at his mother. She was smiling and laughing. Talking to Chresti mostly. Julian decided his dinner was over. \"Hey Lila, you can come to room when you're done if you like,\" Julian breathed the words, wishing he could whisper it into her ears. Instead, the whole table fell silent. Except Lila.\"YAY! Ooooooo can we watch that movie about giant spiders?\" she asked her eyes beaming.Julian nodded and scurried along to his bedroom. He didn't like when everyone looked at him. But he did it for Lila, as he would do for his other siblings.***\"Mimo?\"", "Lila slowly opened Julian's bedroom door and stood quietly peering through. Lila took a while before she could process what was happening. She had never seen her brother like this. The brother that had cared for her, ruffled her hair during movies, shown her how to describe pictures, and made sure Lila was always laughing, was lying on the ground, his mouth and face lurching in a look of agony. Julian screamed. Lila screamed. Lila got pushed past the door as Julian's mother came hurrying in. Julian made a mental note to tell her to never push Lila again. Julian doubted he'd remember anything at all. Doubted he'd ever feel again. The pain in his stomach was so intense he could barely feel it. His mother dropped to her knees and picked him up, her hands clutching a liquid bottle and her face contorted. Her eyes wide. Her lips parched. Her cheeks pale. Julian saw it. There was no denying it. His mother was looking at her son with hate and fear. *** \"Fated; but it doesn't feel right.\" Today, Julian Rosaeles had a dream.", "A dream about his parents. A dream about his siblings. A dream about him: Julian Rosaeles greeted his brothers and sisters to school with a smile on his face. He didn't know if he looked like he was smiling. He hoped he didn't look like what his heart was feeling. Julian let the busy London commuters pass by him as he looked down from his window and observed the city. People roamed freely outside. Some went to work and others like his brothers and sisters; to school. Julian even found himself staring intently at the people than wandered the street; aimlessly roaming the callous London Market Square. As always, narrowing his eyes at the people below, Julian slammmed the window shut and let his ears ring with the numb silence that followed. \"Julian we're leaving! Please close the door behind me! \"Julian heard his mother call out to him. He slowly stepped outside his bedroom and nodded at her. She turned towards the other children all sprawled around her in their uniforms, chatting away to each other. Lila waved at Julian. He waved back. Julian's mother smiled around her children. She smiled wide and she laughed loudly. She also looked back at Julian with a short and strained smile as she closed the door of the apartment. When you had a good for nothing son, you wanted them out of the house. It's natural to see them as a burden. Julian even thought of himself as a burden. It wasn't irrational. It wasn't something he could drown out with love. He didn't feel any love; not from his family. His siblings did not suffer like Julian did. His mother didn't see them as a burden.Julian had always been sick, since his birth. Always being laid in his bed and taken care of. It must get tiring. But Julian had planned to relieve his mother of her torment. He planned to relieve himself of his torment. If they thought of him as burden, he would leave. Once his sickness got better, once he roamed London all by himself, he would leave them behind. He hated them and their notion of a \"Julian the burden.\" Of course, he'd come back for Lila time to time. But just Lila. Because she was the only one that didn't look at him the way they did. She was the only one he'd loved.So, in this trance, Julian slept. Every time in this trance of pride and hate, Julian was able to sleep. The prospect of hope not biting his skin. The prospect of freedom giving him strength. And so, he slept. Each time his stomach relented to his dreams. *** Julian's mother slowly caressed the hair from her son's temple. She put a wet towel on his face as she'd done every time his stomach pain intensified, every time he had a gut-wrenching headache and every time he had sudden fevers. She suffered, even through the clear hatred of her son. Her son that had gotten everything snatched away from him for no good reason. Her son that had never gotten a life. Because living like Julian did wasn't living. She patted his hair. The apartment door lock creaked open. Her husband had returned. She let Julian sleep with one last swirl of her hands over his face and she strolled out of the room. ***\"When you hear the bell----Julian woke up, the church bells treading their way through the air and into his ears.", "It was close to sunrise. Twilight, Julian's favorite part of the day. Julian noticed little droplets of rain begging to kiss the ground of London with harmony. He strolled out his bedroom. His throat was bone dry. The pain in his stomach still ensued. It had been getting worse over the last few days. Julian cursed the gods. How was he supposed to run away when he couldn't barely walk towards his own kitchen? Passing by his parents' bedroom, he heard the low murmur of his mother's voice. He heard his own name and stopped dead in front of the door. \"He's getting worse John, the medicine isn't working,\" his mother was saying, her voice sadder than Julian had ever heard. He wondered when was the last time he actually carefully listened to his mother. All this careful picking out of footsteps and doorknob twists, he'd never given much thought to how her mother always sounded. Right now, she was choking on her words. His hate faltered. \"Samantha, don't worry. We'll go to the doctor's today. It's his 11th birthday today, we should take him with us. He needs to see London, even if it's his first time. \"\"John I-\"\"What's wrong? Is there something you're not telling me? It's hardly fair when you hide these things from me. I don't- I'm not home all the time. Samantha, please. \"\"I'm just so worried for the poor kid. He hates us. I know he does. He thinks I-\"\"Oh, I'm sure he doesn't hate us- that's- that's absurd. He's your son. Our son. And I would know, we have plenty. He doesn't hate you. \"\"You don't get it John. You don't see the way he looks at me. You don't see that way he talks...or doesn't talk to me. To any of us. \"\"I-\"\"I'm just worried he will leave me before I get a chance to explain to him. Explain how much he's had taken away from him and explain how much I love him regardless. I don't know if he'll ever understand us, understand he's not a burden when I look at him with smiling eyes, but he never seems to like it when I smile. He always looks away. Does he see his pain in mine? Does he see mine? He looks at me in disgust sometimes, looks at his siblings in jealousy. How do I tell him my heart burns for him the most, that I love him more than I could love myself? I don't know if he'll ever-\"Her words drowned out as Julian ran back to his bedroom, tears streaming down his eyes. It couldn't be true.", "Her words- Julian choked on the gravity of the words. Choked on his hate, his jealousy, his mistakes. Realization struck him like a freight train, his ears buzzed with guilt and hurt. He gulped fire as his stomach burned and singed with pain. From sickness or guilt? Julian couldn't decide. \" ---bring yourself back to the breath. \"But Julian couldn't breathe. He remembered the Tales Of King James, the story book he'd read out to Lila, her laughing at how the prideful king met his fall because of his big-headed mistakes. Julian wondered whether his sister would remember him as King Jules. Julian cried. Julian's room was a mess, he'd never bothered to fix any of this. He'd never bothered to clean thinking he would be leaving them behind one day anyway. Julian's stomach lurched in pain again. His tongue was bitter. Why had he never made his room look like more of a permanent home than a temporary one? How could he never realize? Looking around his room, something told him he should tidy up. He collected many things but never quite enough. Never tried looking at it from- the words got stuck in his mind. He wanted to be home now more than he ever did. But the shadow in the corner of his room told him; assured him; that it was too late. There was no returning to his home now. A home he'd just realized was his. Julian didn't want to leave his family anymore. Not like this. He'd never told them he loved them. He'd never understood why they looked at him they way they did. Never knew of their love for him. Until now. Guilt parched his throat as it dried out like a desert. He wanted to redecorate his room. Wanted that sense of warmth and comfort in cleaning his room. In showing them how wrong he had been. Even if this was a small payback, he would earn his way through to their forgiveness. He didn't want to make them make decisions based on what he'd done. He wanted to redeco- the words got stuck in his mind again. His stomach now felt like lead, lurching with a pain so intense he wasn't sure how he was standing up. ﻿Julian couldn't see his room, his eyes went black, the edges of his pupils slowly going dark like vignetting pictures. He had no more chances left. Julian didn't scream for help as he lay down on the floor, eyes not completely shut. He whispered apologies to his family and a kiss to Lila hoping the air would carry his thoughts to them through his shut door. Hoping it would carry his love to Lila. To all of them. He couldn't redecorate the life he wanted to live, so Julian kept his failure on display. Soon, Lila and the others would find his. She would cry. As he lay eyes closed giving up to his sickness, his stomach lurched treacherously one last time. Lila would cry. \"I wish I was there for you; what for? I'm not really sure.\" *****************************************************************************Enjoy :)"], "summaries": ["A son, Julian, experiences recurring dreams, showcasing a tense relationship with his mother who tries to connect with him through gestures of care despite an underlying emotional distance.", "Julian struggles with unspoken thoughts and a sense of longing as he contemplates London's beauty amidst his inner turmoil.", "A troubled Julian struggles with family dynamics, displaying a deep emotional rift as he confronts his past and present through interactions with his young sister and mother.", "Julian silently observed his family dynamics during dinner, especially his connection with his youngest sister Lila, as he navigated unspoken tensions and responsibilities.", "Lila discovers her brother Julian in agony on the ground; meanwhile, Julian's mother reveals a surprising reaction towards him as Julian reflects on a troubling dream he had.", "Julian despairs over feeling like a burden to his family as he plans to leave once he's better.

It was like everywhere he was completely white. The tables, chairs, walls, even the beaming lights from above. He sat down in his military uniform. He wasn't wearing this uniform at the time of the battle. He was in camouflage. Now he was in full uniform. He would wear this for eternity. He remembered the battle as if\nwas yesterday. He didn't see the grenade until the last minute. By then, it was\ntoo late. His body flew into the air. Unlike his fellow soldiers in C Company,\nhis body was intact. But here he was. Matthew Phillip Cain, a young man who volunteered\nfor the Army after Pearl Harbor. He left during his final year at Miami\nUniversity in Ohio. He was going to be a lawyer. He had his parents, his\nsister, and Mary Ann, whom he loved, adored, and wrote to her when he could. Her letters were comforting to him during the European theater. She told him\nabout life at secretarial school and volunteering at the USO, meeting young\nsoldiers like him on their way to the front line. His last letter to her was\nwhen he got back, life would be different. He was ready to propose to Mary Ann. He would finish college and begin their lives together. But a grenade ended it\nall. It seems he’s been in heaven for a while. He lost track of time when a familiar face walked in the door. “Captain Cain!” the booming voice screamed. It was private Gerry O’Hearn, who was under his charge. Gerry was a strapping Irish kid from New Jersey. Gerry took the blast worse than he did, but he wasn’t in a military full uniform. He was still in the uniform he wore during the battle. “It’s as if you were never touched.” said Matthew. “I know,” said Gerry, rubbing the top of his reddish hair in a buzzcut. “That’s the crazy part about death, ain’t it? “Tell me about it,” Matthew said. “One minute, we’re charging the Nazis. The next minute, we’re corpses.”\n            “Yeah, but at least you had an actual funeral,” said Gerry. “You’re fully dressed. What’s left of my body was buried on a hill in France.”\n            “You still had full military honors,” Matthew said. “Your family just wasn’t able to there to bury you in fully military honors.”\n            “But we won’t be forgotten, right Cap?” Gerry asked. “I hope this is the case,” said Matthew. “I know Mary Ann won’t forget me.”\n            “Or maybe she’ll find someone else.”\n            “Gee, thanks!”\n            “Oh, I’m sorry, Cap,” said Gerry. “At least you had someone!”\n            “You didn’t have anyone, Gerry?”\n            “I flirted with this Italian girl back in Jersey City,” Gerry boasted. “But her family didn’t like me. I wasn’t ‘paisan’ enough for them. So, we broke it off.”\n            “I know your folks must be heartbroken,” said Matthew. “I know mine are.”\n            “I’m pretty sure my old man held an Irish wake,” said Gerry. “The sad part is there was no body to bury since mine is on a hill in France.”\n            As Matthew and Gerry were speaking, the door opens. A teenage boy walks in.", "Like Matthew and Gerry, he was a soldier, but unlike them he wasn’t wearing camouflage green. He was wearing a blue uniform. Matthew and Gerry stood up and saluted. The young man saluted as well. “Captain Josiah Foster, 43rd Regiment” the young man said. “Here to serve!”\n            “Where did you fall, Captain?” said Matthew! “Shiloh.”\n            “Holy shit, Captain,” said Gerry. “He’s a Civil War soldier.”\n            “Yes sir!” said Josiah. “Where you from?” said Matthew. “Pennsylvania.”\n            “Gettysburg?” snickered Gerry. “Yes, sir!”\n            “You’re above him,” said Matthew. “He’s a private.”\n            “Thanks, Cappy!” said Gerry sarcastically. “That’s fine!” said Josiah. “I was split in two by a Confederate cannon. My poor family never saw my body.”\n            “We have a lot in common,” said Gerry as he put his arm around Josiah who was a few inches shorter and about 20 pounds lighter. “And I promised Rebecca I would return to her.”\n            “Rebecca?”\n            “My intended,” said Josiah. “I asked her father for her hand before I went to battle. But I didn’t get the chance to propose to her.”\n            “I understand,” said Matthew. “I was in your shoes. I didn’t get the chance to propose either.”\n            “Pardon my asking,” said Josiah. “But what war did you two men fight in?”\n            “We fought in the second World War,” said Matthew. “A war about 80 years after yours.”\n            “Really,” said an astonished Josiah. “Who were you fighting?” \n            “We were fighting the axis.” Said Gerry. “What’s an Axis?” said Josiah. Matthew stopped the conversation. “Look, the three of us are soldiers who fought for our country. We may have fought in different wars, but we all served. Unfortunately, we didn’t make it. But we are heroes and there’s a reason why we’re here.”\n            “But why us?” said Josiah. “Why are we here?”\n            “Beats me,” said Gerry. “We’re all pretty handsome guys. Maybe some dead females will be brought to us for company?”\n            “What good will that do?” said Matthew. “We’re spirits. We can walk. We can talk, but we can’t...”\n            “Yeah,” said Gerry. “No makin’ bacon!”\n            “Pardon?” said Josiah. “You have to forgive Gerry,” said Matthew. “We’re from different eras and our words and sayings are different to say the least.”\n            “I understand,” said Josiah. “I still don’t understand a lot of sayings from the present. I was around spirits from the French Revolution, and I couldn’t understand what they were saying. “They were speaking French,” said Gerry. “That’s why you couldn’t understand.”\n            The three men began to laugh when the white door opened. Before they knew it, more soldiers walked in.", "They were from other conflicts: The 100-Days War, the Peloponnesian wars, the Korean conflict, Viet Nam, the Gulf War, the Falkland Islands war. Even soldiers from both World War II and the War Between the States. They spoke many different languages, English, French, German, Japanese, Iraqi. They were all around the same age as Matthew, Gerry, and Josiah. The ones who spoke English gravitated towards the trio. “Staff Sergeant James Johnson,” said a tall black man saluted to Matthew, who returned the salute. “Da Nang”. “Captain Matthew Cain!”\n\t“Lieutenant Jose Nieves.” The Iraqi War veteran saluted. “Private Gerald O’Hearn!” said Gerry. “Where you from?”\n\t“Jersey City, New Jersey!”\n\t“Really? Me too!”\n\tBefore they knew it, the white room became crowded. All the seats were taken. Many of the soldiers were standing or leaning on the white walls. Their uniforms ranged from heavy body armor to today’s army colors. Some soldiers were sitting on the white tables. “Hey, Cap,” said Gerry. “How many soldiers are in the room?”\n\t“Too many,” said Matthew. “It’s hard to breathe in here.”\n\t“I know,” said Josiah. “I’m itching in this uniform.”\n\t“What’s going on in here?” said an English soldier who died in the first World War. “Waarom is ons hier?” said a dead Afrikaner soldier from the Boer War. “What did he say” whispered Josiah to Matthew. “I don’t know,” said Matthew. “But I guess he is wondering why he’s here.”\n\tThe simmering buzz of the solder began to rise to a whirlwind combustible noise, and it became nearly unbearable until the door opened. A woman with white hair, a long white coat, and white shoes stood at the front of the table.", "“SILENCE!” she screamed in several languages. Before the soldiers knew it, the room became quiet. Above her head was a sign in numerous languages to translate. She said she spoke English because it was the easiest to speak. She said her name was Aurora and in a previous life, she was an Amazon who died to save her land. “You have all been chosen for one reason,” said Aurora. “Reincarnation.”\n\t“Rein, what?” said Josiah. Matthew raised his hand. “You mean we’re going back to our lives?” he asked. “Nor exactly,” said Aurora. “You will return to earth, but not as you think. “So, how are we going back?” said an Australian soldier who fought and died at Gallipoli. “You will be sent out from the heavens into the clouds and will fall into the atmosphere.”\n\t“Zašto?” asked a Bosnian soldier. “Because Zlatko,” said Aurora in his language. “You left a lot of unfinished business on earth. “What the hell is she talking about?” said Gerry in his booming voice. “The unfinished business is with the women you loved,” said Aurora. “You are returning to those women.”\n\t“But Rebecca’s dead.” yelled Josiah. “Yes, Rebecca has died,” said Aurora. “But her great-great-great granddaughter is alive, and she has broken up with a young man.”\n\t“So, we will all be paired with the descendants of the women we left?” said Matthew. “Yes,” said Aurora. “Your former intended Mary Ann married a young man who fought in Northern Italy and returned from the war. They met at a barbecue, fell in love, and married. Her great-granddaughter is unmarried, and you will woo her.”\n\t“But how will we know?” A Green Mountain Boy from the Revolutionary War asked. “You will know,” said Aurora. Many of the soldiers began saying the names of their former loves: Abigail, Svetlana, Nasim, Paola, Maya...\n\t“All right, gentleman,” said Aurora. “It’s time to leave.” As she opened the door, the over one thousand dead soldiers walked out the room. As they left the room, all the uniforms the soldiers wore disintegrated, and they were naked.", "“Holy shit,” said Gerry. “I’m going back to earth nude?”\n\t“Yes,” said Matthew. “I guess so.”\n\tAurora and heaven’s security lined up the naked soldiers as they bunched up at the edge of heaven. Before they left, Josiah was told Rebecca’s great-great-grand niece lives in a state he had never heard of: Arizona. “It became a state after the war,” said Matthew. “I heard it’s nice.”\n\tThe Italian girl Gerry flirted with has a great-great-granddaughter who lives in Rochester, New York and is a nurse. “Wait ‘til she gets a hold of this body,” said Gerry. “She won’t be able to resist me.”\n\t“I’m pretty sure you’ll find clothes.”\n\t“What if they ask about where we came from?” said Josiah. “I overheard Aurora tell the Kamikaze pilot that our memories will be erased,” said Matthew. “We’ll see!”\n\tAurora rose above the sea of naked men. “Alright, gentlemen,” she said. “It is time leave. Once you say goodbye, you will fall into the atmosphere.”\n\tThe men said goodbye and before they knew it, the floor collapsed under their feet, and they fell. The heavens literally rained men from the sky. The bodies were tall, short, pudgy, sculptured, thin, black, white, Asian, Spaniard, indigenous, and they were falling. “Hey, Cappy,” said Gerry. “Look at me! I’m doing somersaults! Take care!”\n\t“Take care!” said Matthew, as he watched thousands and thousands of naked men falling closer and closer to Earth. Matthew watched Josiah fall and said goodbye. Matthew was falling and falling and falling and then he lost consciousness. When he did fall, he woke up and was wearing a green shirt, blue jeans, and white sneakers.", "He found himself in a cemetery. He found himself on a grave with a headstone that read TATE. Below the name was JOHN SPENCER 1918-2004 and MARY ANN BENNETT 1920-2018. “Mary Ann” he whispered. She had married a man named John Tate and lived a long life. When he arose from the grave, a willowy blonde who resembled Mary Ann stood there in shock. She was holding a bouquet of flowers and it was broad daylight. She was in shock. “Who are you and what are you doing here?” said the blonde. “Are you related to them?” asked Matthew. “Yes, they’re my grandparents.”\n            “Was she a good woman, your grandmother?”\n            “Great-grandmother,” she said. “And she was a. wonderful woman.”\n            “What’s your name?” Matthew asked. “Marianne,” she said. “I was sort of named after my grandmother, except my parents thought it should be one name instead of two.”\n            “It’s a pretty name.”\n            “Who are you?”\n            “My name is Matthew.”\n            “Where did you come from?”\n            “You wouldn’t believe me if I told you.”"], "summaries": ["Matthew and Gerry, soldiers in the afterlife, reminisce about their past experiences in the war and their unfulfilled lives back on Earth when a mysterious teenage boy unexpectedly enters the room.", "Three soldiers from different eras, Captain Josiah Foster, Matthew, and Gerry, meet as spirits and share their war stories, finding common ground despite their time differences.", "Soldiers from different wars and eras find themselves in a white room together, struggling with the crowded space and diverse languages until a mysterious woman with white hair appears.", "Aurora reveals to a group of chosen soldiers that they will be reincarnated to resolve unfinished business with the women they loved, connecting with their descendants in a surprising twist of fate.", "Gerry, Matthew, and Josiah find themselves returning to Earth naked with their memories about to be erased, each with connections to people waiting for them below in different states.

He extended his arm with a firm handshake. “How are you?” \n\t“You know, I’m alright,” I answered vaguely. Charles smelled like smoke mixed with the fresh bread and chestnuts sold on the streets. “How ‘bout you?”\n\t“Doing well,” he said, smiling. I wanted to smile when he did; he still had that effect on me. “That’s good. Wanna go get a drink?”\n\t“Sure.”\n\tWe walked away down the street. To anyone else, it would’ve looked like a meeting of two old friends, which, in part, it was. But Charles and I knew it was something different: it was a signal. A flash of light lit up the ground near our feet for a moment, and we knew the signal had been received. We weren’t going to go get a drink, either. We walked awkwardly, not touching each other, towards one of the many abandoned shops in this part of the city.", "It was snowing. My boots made deep tracks. I noticed that Charles wasn’t wearing any shoes; his feet were just covered in bits of old cloth. I pulled at the buttons on my coat. I kicked little drifts of snow out ahead of me. I rubbed my hands together. I knew I was just doing something to fill the time, to keep me occupied. I’d been doing that since I was a kid. I saw Charles pull his coat tighter around him. I wondered why he didn’t just button it, but then I saw some of the buttons on his coat were gone. “Are you really doing alright?” I asked, just to say something. As soon as I said it, I saw a change in him. “Yeah, fine.” He didn’t sound angry, but I’ve always been able to tell when he was lying, though today I didn’t know why he would. We didn’t speak again until we got to the shop, our shop, though we didn’t really own it.", "The display windows in the front were broken, and glass littered the floor. There was graffiti on the walls, inside and outside, and a rotted old wood sign above the equally rotted door that said, Melbourne Music. There used to be instruments lining the walls, evident by the metal hooks that remained. A grand piano was the central point in the room. My eyes were drawn to it immediately, with its broken strings, missing keys, and one bent leg. There was red spattered on the ivory, making me think some kind of brawl had happened here. This wasn’t the best part of town. “Looks different than I remember,” Charles said. In the warm glow of the setting sun, I saw him try to smile. It was the same smile I remembered, sort of tilted, crooked, cute. But it no longer looked carefree like it used to. It seemed tired and overwhelmed. “Did you ask Ches to come?” I said. “Yeah, but he said he couldn’t. D’you know he has a kid now?”\n\t“Oh.” I was surprised by this, and maybe a little saddened. I knew I should be happy for him. I didn’t know why I wasn’t. “Good for him.” \n\t“Yeah.” More lies. We stood there silently until we heard a thump outside. By now, it was too dark to see. “Who’s in there?” a deep voice demanded. I heard a metallic flick from beside me. I was too afraid to look. “Put your hands up!” The door was thrown open on its rusty hinges, and a figure entered.", "I lit a match as the door opened, illuminating the features of Henry Anwall, not a police officer. “Jesus Christ!” I said, and stumbled backwards into the piano, playing discordant notes. “What’s wrong with you?” I laughed, catching my breath. I turned around to look at Charles behind me. He was tucking something into his pocket. His knife. His hands were shaking, and he didn’t say a word. “Hey, guys! Ready for tonight?” Henry said, always laughing and cocky. I had no idea where Henry lived or what he did with his time. I don’t think anybody did. When we didn’t answer, he continued, “Anybody got anything?”\n\tHe was really directing that question at me, and of course I knew what he meant. I got an oydeynil out of my pocket and lit it for him with the last of the match. “Share,” I warned, and he nodded, waving his hands at me and puffing light green smoke. The store filled up with the smell, but I was used to it. I kind of liked it. I lit another match so we could see. It was practically dark now, and even darker in the store. Meanwhile, Charles didn’t talk. I used to call him Charlie. What happened to us? “So, you guys wanna go now?” Henry asked as he blew smoke out his mouth. He was leaned up against the wall. I was sitting on the piano bench, which was relatively unharmed. I began to stand up. “Sure.”\n\tCharles was farther back in the shadows, enough so that even with my small light, I couldn’t see him at all. “Wait. I don’t think I should do this this year.”\n\t“Aw, come on, we’ve done it every year since we were kids. Besides, you hate the guy,” Henry said. “Yeah, well, smashing the former mayor’s window isn’t exactly legal.”\n\t“Since when do you care? You raised a knife at me a few minutes ago because you thought I was the police!” Henry protested. “I do now.”\n\t“Ansel?” \n\t“I dunno,” I said uneasily. Henry may be overconfident and reckless, but he was right about one thing: since when was Charles afraid to get in a little trouble? Something was going on. “Really? Now you’re backing out? What happened to you guys? I swear, it’s like you’re in love with Charlie or something, the way you always side with him. It’s always been this way, ever since we were kids. I’ll just go by myself.” He laughed bitterly. “Wait, Henry, I never said that-” But really, what was I protesting against? Henry stalked out the door, alone.", "He quickly disappeared into the darkness. My match went out again, and I didn’t bother getting another. Henry had taken the oydeynil with him. And if there was no light, no one would know we were here. I might’ve laughed when Henry played that trick on us, but it scared me. “Is something going on?” I asked into the darkness. I heard a sigh. “So you know last year, when I said money was tight?”\n\tI nodded then remembered he couldn’t see me. “Yeah.”\n\t“I lost my job. My landlord kicked me out when I couldn’t pay rent.”\n\t“You could’ve asked me for help.”\n\t“I didn’t want to bother you.”\n\t“Don’t say that.”\n\tSilence. “Where’ve you been living?” I asked tentatively. “Everywhere. Places like this or benches when it’s nice enough. I’m a busker now. I can make enough every day to get a little food, and this guy I know gives me a beer if I clean the bar.” A pause. “Sometimes I drink from the gutters.”\n\tWe sat in silence for a while. I really didn’t know what to say. I lit an oydeynil. “Want any?” I asked. He came over to sit on the bench beside me, and I handed it to him. He was slouching. Charles never used to slouch. “I wonder if Henry’s really gonna go through with it without us,” he said. “I dunno. Remember the time he got drunk and said he was fireproof?”\n\t“How could I forget? He put his hand in a bonfire.” He laughed softly. His laugh was the most familiar, most calming sound in the world to me. “I wonder if he still has the scar.” I was smiling. “There was the time Ches started taking his clothes off in the bar and we had to take him home.”\n\t“Yeah.” That was a less than fond memory for me, for a lot of reasons. “Weren’t you, like, talking to a girl or something and he puked down her shirt?”\n\t“Yep.” That was one reason. The girl had screamed and tried to punch him, then ran to the bathroom. I had been drunk. That was the only reason I’d talked to her. More quiet. We passed the oydeynil back and forth. Oydeynil was something I’d been doing since I was around 12 years old, probably. It didn’t exactly get you high, and you couldn’t really get addicted to it. It was somewhere in between. I knew it wasn’t good for me, but oydeynil gives me a sense of calm that I can’t accomplish on my own. My head is always buzzing, nonstop, with all kinds of noises, voices, accusations, just thoughts that I can’t turn off. Oydeynil takes it away, if only temporarily. “Remember when we kissed?” Charles said, so quietly I almost couldn’t hear him. I was shocked. We hadn’t ever brought that up. That time in our youth seemed, for a while, to just stay in our past. When we had grown apart, it disappeared. I thought he’d moved on, and I guess I thought I had too. My heart thumped in my chest. “Yeah,” I said breathlessly after a moment. “Can I call you Charlie?”\n\tIt was quiet, then he said thoughtfully, “Yeah. I don’t know why you ever stopped.” \n\t“Do you think Henry knows?” \n\t“About how we used to be?”  \n\t“Yeah.”\n\t“No. Henry thinks too fast to know what’s going on right around him,” he replied. “Do you remember how we used to call each other names when the others weren’t around?”\n\t“Yeah.” I paused here. “Do you think Henry and Ches would understand if we told them?”\n\t“Why would we? You know the punishment for that. I don’t know what they think.”\n\t“Oh.”\n\tSilence. “Did you catch what Henry said, just before he left?” he asked, and it seemed like then, in the darkness, we were the only two people in the world. How could I forget? It was something that no one else would catch but me and Charlie. “Are you still?”\n\tI kissed him, and he kissed me back.", "Almost awkwardly, but I remembered when we used to do that often, whenever we thought it would be safe. I remembered a scene from when we were teenagers. ...\n \n“Ansel?” Charlie’s voice, from across his great-uncle’s empty music shop. “Yeah?”\n\t“Did they leave?”\n\t“Uh-huh.” I was sitting on a piano bench, possibly the same one I was sitting on now. “Well, I gotta go. Bye, hon. Love ya,” he said as he picked up his coat from beside me, and leaned over to kiss me. It had all the buttons on it, and he was wearing shoes. There weren’t circles under his eyes and stress lines on his forehead. There wasn’t unshaven stubble growing on his chin. But now, I didn’t care about how much he’d changed, how much everything had changed. I used to think about times like that, and it would make me unbearably sad. It would feel like a stab in the chest to know I could never have that again. I always hate when people say, “Don’t be sad it’s over, be glad it happened.” What’s the point of that? I missed him, and I wasn’t going to sit there happily, knowing I might not ever see him again, and knowing if somehow I did, and things went back to the way they used to be, that there was always a risk. Always a risk. Someone would find out eventually. Now I had it all again, and I wasn’t ready for it to be taken away. ... I heard the smash of glass, far away in the dark night. I felt his arms wrap around me in the embrace I never thought I would feel again, his arms protecting me, keeping me safe from anyone who would try to hurt us. I hugged him back, and let the oydeynil fall to the ground. I rested my head on his shoulder. I wanted to stay like this forever. I heard a sound.", "A gasp.

She starts acting weird and starts to stay away from her friends group. She used to do all sorts of things from bullying to disrespecting the teachers. What had happened in the past few days, that she became something else. She wasn't herself anymore.I was so anxious to know what had happened to her. I was about to tap on her shoulder when I heard a familiar voice from the back, \" Rose come on, you're gonna get late for class.\"", "When I slowly turned around, I saw my best friend Jackie from across the hall. I was just about to go to class when I saw Brenda was gone. I thought to myself how did she leave so fast. After science class, I saw Brenda in the hallway again, talking to herself. I became concerned, so I went up to her, but then I saw her light green eyes turn red. I freaked out and screamed, but that was no use. I forgot that I couldn't speak since my vocal cords were damaged 3 years ago in a car accident. I was hopeless and terrified at the same time. How did Brenda's eyes turn so red like the horns of the devil. I was glad that she hadn't seen me.", "A few days later, I was walking down the street in my neighborhood and I saw someone walking besides me. I looked like a teenage girl. When I looked to my left, I fell to the floor. I barely caught my breath when Brenda started to become something I couldn't even describe. Her eyes turned red and her pale skin slowly became blue. At this point, I knew something was wrong with her. Finally, I ran home and locked all the doors.", "I was in complete shock. I couldn't imagine what I had just witnessed. When I started to come back to reality, I decided to take a nap when I saw a black ring in my hand. I knew it wasn't mine, because I hated jewelry. But this ring was kind of different. I wanted to take it off but something was stopping me. I thought it had something to do with Brenda. So I kept the ring on, since I had no other choice. The next morning when I was getting ready for school, I saw a black shadow in my mirror telling me, \" reveal their truth.\" I wasn't scared of the shadow somehow, but before I could ask any questions, the shadow disappeared. I started to question myself about all the weird things that had happened in the past few days, and now this black shadow in my bathroom mirror.", "After a long period of thinking, I took my school bag and headed for school.

I fell to the floor and woke up in the hospital.", "My mother was crying and I was confused. But I was thinking about what I had seen in school. Why did Jackie look so weird and how was Brenda like that in public? Then, I looked at my ring and understood everything.

But then I thought to myself, \"how did the ring even get to me.\"", "So, the next morning when I was brought home from the hospital, I sneaked out of the house and went to school. When I got to school I saw Jackie. She was with the same vampire look. But I knew that was what she was outside of school, and now I understood why she always wore a hoodie, to stay away from the sunlight. I went up to her and she was about to give me a hug, when she felt a shock while touching me. I think it had something to do with the ring.", "She thought it was just the normal shock people get when they are close to each other, since we were “best friends.” Later that day, I started talking to Jackie at lunch using sign language . But this time, I noticed something weird. Every time I talked to Jackie, I could read her mind. I was of course shocked because when I asked her what she did over the weekend. She verbally said “ I went to the beach to get a tan and to the mall.” But when I looked into her eyes and read her mind, she actually said “ I stayed home until the sun went down and went out to look for some victims to drink their blood.” I couldn’t control myself and I gasped really loud. Everyone in the cafeteria was staring at me. But then I gave that awkward laugh and looked at Jackie. She asked me why I responded like that. So I just made up a story and told her I saw a fly on her cheeks and changed the topic. A few days later, when I was doing a project in English class with Brenda and other group members, I asked Brenda and the others to meet up after school to finish the project since it was going to be our final grade. Everyone agreed but Brenda told us that she had to go to the doctor after school and that she couldn’t make it. But then, I used my talent of reading minds and looked deep into her light green eyes and actually heard her say “ you think I’m dumb, I know you saw me that day in the hallway when my eyes turned red, whenever I get the chance I will get rid of you.\" I gasped loud, but to make it look normal I just pretended to yawn.

The location of the far end of her wormhole remains fixed and unknown, though it is clear that it resides within an ocean, as nothing but water comes through the opening. Ri is thus able to call upon the force of boundless waters and direct them in numerous and destructive ways, making her one of the more potent elites of The Fourth squadron. On one extreme; Ri can open her corridor as wide as her outstretched arms by three; creating a river-like force where water flows forward for a distance but is then reabsorbed by the opening; leaving no trace outside of the havoc wreaked. Inversely she can contract and concentrate the aperture in such a way so as to produce a pressurizing effect that turns the funneled water in to a force of potentially oceanic proportions; nothing stands in her way.

Like their third father “Tyke the Protector“; both twins display tremendous capacities as elite defenders; though again like their third father both exhibit questionable character while being hard for many to tolerate in most instances. Ri is by little the less likely of the twins to be reasoned with or asked for companionship as her sister does at least maintain an appealing if not seductive visage and a veiled, if not suspicious concern for what others are going through. Ri pretends to like no one (save a warrior or two) and despises her sister’s unwillingness to be as nasty as she really is in Ri’s own opinion. The two girls were born shortly after Tyke was publicly disgraced by the then young Nevari—and so grew up not knowing the same reverence or status that their family had been aligned with in previous times.", "After their father transcended they would spend the following becoming cycles (teenage years) bouncing between their few remaining family members and “The Orphans Guild of Mursi”.

Among their peers Vadra and Ri would become known as troublemakers, with the older having several incidents involving sexual misconduct and intimidating, while the younger was continually getting into fights in support of her sisters exploits. Being the powerhouse that she is, on one occasion the mighty Gen. Reen was disrupted from a holiday to subdue the young, outraged water goddess who was intoxicated beyond her limit. An occasion that deepened the wariness some elites had with the powerful young sisters and the first in a string of what would become several “Mursi vs Umbra” hearings.

As the two would advance in importance, so too did the moral dilemma’s, raised by the pairs oft-times excessive and even cruel treatment of supposed adversaries. While it was unclear for quite some time where exactly Lt. Vadra had been sending the long list of combatants she’d faced and dismissed, it was quite clear that Lt. Ri Umbra had very little regard for life not of Mursian blood, and an only slightly higher tolerance for life that was.

A scuffle that both ravaged an area that had been planned to be utilized for Mursian development as well as greatly straining the relationship held with the benefactors that had provided our destitute civilization with a chance to start again within their enormous and bountiful world. While it was true that the Bulwark was in an area decreed to have been a Mursian land, Ri attacking the sentinel without provocation was clearly unacceptable when a resolve to the misunderstanding was so easily reachable through dialogue. It was at this point that the two sisters were categorized as wayward and were given the choice to either face the entire Elite squadron in battle or face their young squad mate Lt.

She would not make them in to new people nor remove their undesirable traits; in fact all that she said she’d be willing to do was allow them to feel just a little bit more than they had been feeling.

It'll be fun.\" \"I don't know, dude. I haven't been sledding in five years.\" \"It's going to be a great night Beau.\" \"Do you know how many trees we could have planted with the money we're spending on sledding?\" \"We've already got plenty of trees here.\" \"You're sure it's going to snow tonight? And Jordan's not going to just bail on us?\" \"Yeah, man. He just texted. He's riding a blizzard to us as we speak.\" \"Well, that's comforting. Though, I still feel a little nervous about sledding, Shane. I haven't gone sledding since college.\" \"I know, Beau. But remember how much fun you had the last time?\" THE LAST TIME...\n \nShane and I were getting ready to go sledding.", "He had come up to visit me at college and brought a snowstorm with him. We'd spent the night playing pool and ended up closing down the bar. We stumbled home but made a quick detour before we entered my dorm. My dorm room was in the bottom floor of the building. Before going inside, I peeked down through the window to check to see if my roommate Roger was asleep. Roger was a bit of a dink. Hyperactive at the best of times and the last person I wanted to go sledding with. Luckily, he was asleep. Shane and I snuck into my dorm room and grabbed our sledding stuff. Then with nowhere else to go, we decided to head to the bathroom. There were two men's bathrooms on our floor that all the guys shared, but it was the middle of the night so the chances of anyone walking in on us getting ready were slim. We were standing in the handicap stall, getting ready to go sledding, when the bathroom door burst open. Shane and I froze. Not because someone had just walked into the bathroom, but because of what we heard. \"Oh. My. God. Look at the urinals.\" Two incredibly drunk girls had stumbled into the men's room. Shane and I stifled our laughter and continued to listen. \"You think I can pee in the urinal if I bend backward and keep my hips over the pee-hole?\" one of the girls asked. \"No. You need a dick,\" the other giggled. \"We need dick you mean. Alex is being such a jerk. I'm done with that loser. And I can't believe Tony never texted you back.\" It was at that moment, full of drunken confidence, that I opened the stall door. \"I've got your dick right here, ladies.\" At first the girls looked at me like I'd just insulted their mothers. Then the girls, a blonde and a red head, noticed Shane holding our sled. \"What are you guys doing?\" the blonde asked coyly. \"We're about to go sledding,\" Shane said. \"Why are you in the bathroom?\" the red head asked. \"Why are you in our bathroom?\" Shane shot back. In the next moment, I said, \"We're actually avoiding my roommate.\" \"I'm Stacey and this is Laura,\" the blonde said. \"And we'd love to go sledding with you,\" Laura said. The girls, Shane, and me sledded down two big white hills each. Then the girls announced it would be fun to change things up. Putting aside our tubular toboggan, our bodies became the sleds. Laura squeezed her hills together and Shane sledded over the arch of one mound quickly, then took his time on the other. It was my turn to be Stacey's slope. I stood at attention, trying to remain perfectly still. It was an odd situation. All I could think was, \"Isn't the cold going to numb me? That's what it does right? I'm pretty sure I'm going to want to feel what happens next.\" I stood at full attention and tried my best to hold perfectly still. Sledding had left me exhilarated and it was hard not to shiver, but I managed not to move. Stacey made her way down my left leaning incline. Then she climbed back up and kissed me. From there, things went from Winter Wonderland to Your Body is a Wonderland. ###\n \n\"Come on, Beau.", "You know that night was epic.\" \"Yeah, Shane. It was but there's no way tonight's going to be as epic.\" \"You never know, dude. Jordan's bringing some friends.\" \"Are any of those friends girls?\" \"I don't know, but whoever they turn out to be, I'm sure they'll be cool.\" \"I'm don’t know how I feel about sledding with strangers. Shit, I don't even know Jordan that well.\" \"Stacey and Lauren were strangers.\" \"Yeah, but they were hot! Jordan could be bringing a bunch of dudes.\" \"So what? We'll still have a good time.\" \"I don't know. I think I'm better at sledding when it's a small group. People I know well or plan to get to know intimately. I mean, you remember what happened the first time I ever went sledding.\" THE FIRST TIME...\n \nMy first time sledding was back in high school.", "I was sitting in my first period shop class next to a guy named Trevor. Shop was the only class Trevor and I had together, and we weren't really friends. But our senses of humor lined up and we cracked each other up quoting Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle. On the Friday before winter break, Trevor turned to me and said, \"Dude, you want to skip out on class and go sledding?\" \"I don't know, man. The teacher's right there.\" \"Oh, he doesn't care. He's half asleep and obviously not trying to teach today anyway. Shit, it's not like we're working on a project. He put on Empire Strikes Back and is about five minutes from drifting off.\" \"What is it with teachers at this school and Empire Strikes Back?\" I asked, trying to change the subject. \"Every time a teacher doesn't feel like teaching, they put on this movie. Do they all pass around the same copy or does each classroom get its own? \"Come on, man. Let's go sledding. You're always so chill. I want to see what you're like when you're all jacked up on winter sports.\" Eventually I relented and Trevor and I snuck away and went sledding. We began with a couple of small hills a piece. Then we each did a big hill. The slope was rather rough. It could be because it was my first time sledding. Or perhaps the snow wasn't fresh enough. Though, I think it was most likely that there was saw dust mixed in with the snow. Next period, I had English with Ms. Gray. Between the taboo thrill of having cut class to go sledding, the elation the activity brought me, and the pure bewilderment that someone I barely knew would share such an experience with me, I was feeling great. Ms. Gray started class and I began to feel jittery. We were discussing A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court and I kept interrupting my classmates to give long, incomprehensible answers. I was just feeling too good to care about polite decorum, and Shane wasn't helping. He sat two desks away, and laughed at everything I said. A few minutes later, I got really hot. Luckily, I sat next to the window, so I turned around and opened it. These windows, big rectangles of glass in thick metal frames, opened outward. You'd twist the handle and pull the pane toward you. As I opened the window, I looked down and saw two seniors playing Frisbee on the school lawn. \"Hey Ms. Gray,\" I called, interrupting her mid-sentence. \"There's some guys playing Frisbee. I'm going to go join them.\" I then proceeded to try and squeeze myself through the foot wide opening between the windowpane and frame. \"Beau, you can't fit through that window,\" Ms. Gray chuckled. \"The hell I can't,\" I called back. I'm just lucky she liked me, or else things would have gone a lot worse. All Ms. Gray did was laugh, as my inability to squeeze through the gap proved her right. Then Ms. Gray picked up the phone and called the school resource officer, informing him that the guys were out of class and playing Frisbee on the lawn. Acting fast, I called out the window, \"Guys! Run! She's calling the fuzz!\" From there the story stops being interesting. Ms. Gray sent me to the principal's office. I didn't get into any trouble, but it was a real bummer. A sure-fire way to end the euphoria sledding brings it to have to explain your crazy actions to an authority figure. ###\n \n\"That's why I'm hesitant about this Shane.", "Things don't always work out well when I go sledding.\" \"Come on, Beau. Nothing that bad happened. Plus, I know you went sledding a couple times after that. You've gotten better at keeping the fun in check.\" \"Yeah, but you just never know.\" \"Hey, we're a lot smarter now. Plus, we're in our own home and we'll be surrounded by good people. Hell, maybe you'll get to actually throw a Frisbee this time.\" \"You do have a point. This sledding trip will be safer. I just don't know how much fun I'm going to have tonight. You know I prefer chill nights at home.\" \"Don't worry, dude. Tonight is going to be a blast!\" TONIGHT...\n \nAfter I graduated from college, I decided not to move back home.", "I stayed in my college town and Shane moved across the state to join me and we got a place together. We spent our days working dead end food service jobs and our nights partying. Sharing handles of cheap vodka and an enthusiasm for climbing trees. We were living lives that were going nowhere, but neither of us was in a hurry to change. Things were good, but I knew Shane was excited for a break from our routine and so, he'd made plans for us to go sledding. That night it was me and Shane, his girlfriend Dannie, and his coworker Jordan, who ended up bringing along two guys named Kyle and Stephen. Jordan also brought his girlfriend. Within five minutes of meeting her, before I'd even learned her name, she announced that she was a stripper. She followed up that announcement by chugging down an impressive amount of vodka. Then she let out a huge belch, lit a cigarette, and began blowing intricate smoke rings. Seeing her handy work float through the air and dissolve, she announced that she was tricky. I'm not sure that I ever caught her name, but from that moment on, we all just called her Tricky. Ready to go sledding, we got into a rotation. It was Shane, Kyle, Stephen, Jordan, Tricky, Dannie, and then me. As we waited for our turns, we all took vodka shots together and appreciated a variety of trees. We each sledded down a small hill, just to get warmed up. Then Dannie and I waited. And waited. And waited for our next turn. We snuggled together for warmth and comfort as Shane and the guys talked sports. This was a subject I had no interest in, so I spent my time chatting with Dannie and chain smoking. Dannie kept trying to interject in the guys' conversation, in a feeble attempt to get Shane to pay attention to her. She was getting more and more frustrated that he wasn't acknowledging her. Whenever Shane did speak to her, it was sarcastic and often a little mean. I did my best to make Dannie smile. I wanted to make sure she had a good time. This was the normal pattern with Shane and me. He was always a little mean to his girlfriends and generally aloof and unavailable. I would end up being the “emotional support human” to his girlfriend and then at the end of the night, he'd get to enjoy the physical stuff. I didn't really mind this unspoken arrangement. Shane's girlfriends were always cool, beautiful, and fun to talk to. Plus, I've always enjoyed making girls laugh. Eventually, I realized we hadn't gotten a turn on the sled in over twenty minutes. I mentioned this to Dannie and realization dawned on her face. \"Hey, Tricky! Quit hogging the sled. We paid our share for this trip; we want our turn too!\" After that, Dannie and I each got to do another small hill before Shane suggested we all play a drinking game called Assholes and Presidents. The game has rules, but the main objective is to get the asshole as drunk as possible. Midway through the game, it turned out Shane and the guys had decided to make Dannie the asshole. They kept choosing her to drink and making fun of her. She tried to laugh it all off, letting the booze numb her frustration while I tried to shift the game's focus to Tricky. Shane made a particularly cruel comment to Dannie, and everyone but me laughed. At this point, I could tell she was pissed. I expected her to storm off, as she'd done before. Instead, I felt her hand slide along my thigh. She didn't bother to hide her movements, though the blanket we were sharing helped to conceal what was happening. Even if the blanket hadn't of been there, I doubt Shane would have noticed. Or cared if he had noticed. Dannie unzipped my fly and soon I was in the palm of her hand, trying to keep a straight face as we continued to play the game. After only a few minutes, I turned the underside of the blanket into a White Christmas. Eventually, Stephen and Kyle left, and Shane passed out in his recliner. Dannie gave me a sly look, and I took her hand and led her to my room. I doubt Jordan would have ratted me out to Shane if he'd noticed Dannie and I leaving, but that wasn't something I ended up having to worry about. Jordan and Tricky were making out hard and I think they'd forgotten that we were even there to begin with. Dannie and I spent the night together and fell asleep in each other's embrace. We were woken up the next morning by the sound of the front door slamming. Then we heard Jordan shouting, \"That bitch! What the hell? I can't believe it. That bitch!\" Dannie and I hurried into the living room to see what Jordan was going on about. He quickly explained that Tricky had robbed him. \"She took all the money out of my wallet and my stole my car!\" \"Are you sure, dude?\" I asked. \"Hell yeah I'm sure. I just went out and checked. My car is gone. So's my phone and --\"\n \nJordan stopped speaking abruptly. He looked all around and then began rifling through his bag. Finally, he dejectedly slumped down into a chair and visible sadness washed over him. \"She also took my sled.\" I leaned in close to Shane and whispered, \"Well, at least some of us had a blast last night.\""], "summaries": ["Shane convinces Beau to go sledding despite Beau's hesitations, recalling their last sledding adventure.", "After a night of sledding adventures with unexpected company, things take an unexpected turn for Beau as he finds himself entangled in a romantic encounter in the midst of a snowy escapade.", "A group of friends reminisce about a memorable night and anticipate another eventful evening, unsure of what to expect.

For me, public speaking is situated in an entirely different realm than small talk: when talking in front of many people, you often have time to prepare, time to ease your mind. When in everyday social situations, I freeze up. I’m not able to practice or anticipate what I’ll need to say, and often can’t get the words out even when I can. If you’re a psychologist, you’d probably assume that I have social anxiety (you’d be right). Regardless, attempting to push myself out of my comfort zone to socialize has become my number one priority lately. After all, isn’t that the best way to get better? I’m not entirely sure (you’re the therapist, not I), but I’m willing to give almost anything a try at this point. You’re probably thinking, “O.K., cool.", "So you say you’re going to make an effort, but where’s the proof?” Well, the other day I was at Starbucks waiting in line when I noticed that the barista that was about to serve me had exceptionally beautiful hair; it was carefully tossed up into a voluminous, strategically messy bun, and had streaks of caramel blonde intertwined with its espresso-coloured base. I immediately realized that I had to let her know how much I admired her hair—she’d be getting a compliment (and who’s ever mad about that?) while I’d be taking my step out of my comfort zone; one might say it would be a win-win. Suddenly, I was second in line. In my head, I began carefully rehearsing the five simple words that would form my comfort zone-defying compliment: I really love your hair. As I approached the till to place my order, I came to the realization that I had overlooked one crucial point: rehearsing my drink order. As I stumbled through describing my version of a caramel macchiato: medium—no, grande—lactose-free milk, less caramel, and one shot of vanilla, I slowly lost sight of the compliment I had meticulously planned. Looking up to acknowledge the inevitable, “anything else?” that followed my excruciating drink order, I caught a glimpse of the perfectly imperfect bun once again and remembered my original goal. I had forgotten my plan, but I remember thinking to myself, “it’s just a compliment, easy-peasy. What’s the worst that could happen?” Perhaps it was the anticipation of getting my caramel macchiato, or the caffeine buzz that I still had from my morning coffee (which, mind you, only increases anxiety, no matter how wonderful coffee may be), but I decided to immediately blurt out, “Hey, I really...” as she asked for my name for my order. How humiliating! I turned red, simultaneously embarrassed about having interrupted the barista and having given up on my compliment, and quickly muttered “Uh, it’s Sarah” before speed-walking away to the pickup counter. My name’s not Sarah, but I was worried they would misspell or mispronounce my real name, and I’d already had enough disappointment for one afternoon. Now you’re probably thinking, “So you had an awkward encounter in a coffee shop, big whoop.", "We’ve all been there.” I don’t disagree, but I want to reiterate how my mind works. Think: a car going 500 miles/hour that abruptly stops instead of blasting through green lights. Not the best analogy, but again, I do often struggle to get my thoughts out right. If the Starbucks encounter didn’t convince you of my inability to carry on conversations (despite my ever-busy mind) here’s another situation that I find myself in far too often: online dating.", "Online dating in itself is stressful. The endless swiping, catfishing, and navigating through what seems to be an ocean of cheesy pickup lines can be daunting, to say the least. You might interject here and say, “Well if you don’t like online dating, why do you do it?” Well, ever-critical voice in my head, I think we’re both aware of the extent of my social skills at this point, so I’ll leave it at that. That being said, I don’t like to make the first move on dating sites (you’ll NEVER catch me on Bumble). However, coming up with responses to cheesy, sometimes overly sexual, pickup lines and spams of nothing but “hey” is not my strong point either. For instance, I had someone start off our conversation with “I’m not a photographer, but I can picture me and you together.” A valiant attempt at a pickup line, but what am I supposed to respond to it??? My instinct in this case was “Nice to meet you,” to hint at how strange it is to tell someone you’ve just (barely) met that you could picture yourself with them. However, I opted to leave them on read. The problem, though, is that I do that to everyone. This behaviour may seem problematic, especially if I ever hope to find love online (though saying it out loud makes it sound less appealing...), but I truly can’t do much better. Anything I would even vaguely consider saying to my online love interests would be so carefully thought out and revised that it would take me hours to compose a worthy message (by my standards). There’s even been times where I have taken forever to write the perfect message, yet I find myself too embarrassed by the amount of effort and time it took to write it that I usually give up and never press send. If it wasn’t clear before, it should be clear now: I’m a woman of many words (in my head, that is), with the social skills of a shy toddler.", "I've always been this way, and I have a feeling I always will be.

Manual work was swapped as well, and factories took over the need of providing the goods for society. Every corner of the world was brimming full of these changes, but there are those in secret corners that have retained certain customs.", "Grandpa Anders was one of those special individuals, and he resided with his lovely wife in a quiet, peaceful farm on the other side of the world, where almost none came to visit. His family was the exception however. Every weekend his beloved grandchildren, Rebecca and George, would stay at his farm, while the parents were traveling. Old Anders wasn’t much of a conversationalist, but his heart glowed red whenever he saw their lovely faces. Being a girl, Rebecca often spent time with grandma Marie, and the two would mostly chatter about their concerns and do various activities together. One of their favorite pastimes was to tease Anders and have him confused over a joke that flew over his head. Meanwhile, young Georgie’s main trait was the ability to shelter himself from the others with the help of his machines. Although he loved and talked to his grandparents, his mind was fixated on entertaining itself through technology, primarily videogames. From the morning rise of the sun to the arrival of the dark moon, he would spend most of his time on screens. The grandmother of course took his games away during meals, and sometimes in the living room, but the grandfather observed him more and more whenever he came, and his heart turned grey. Despite all that, one unforgivable act of his grandson that he frowned upon was wasting his slices of cheese. Old Anders wasn’t particularly fond of processed, factory-made cheese but he accepted it as a necessity for a healthy lifestyle and a source of food for families. George on the hand always threw away his slices whenever they were served in sandwitches. He took them out and tossed them in the trash bin. Grandpa observed this habit for several weeks, until one day his heart snapped inside. One afternoon, instead of eating together at the dining room as they normally did, Anders said: “ Georgie, come with me for a minute.” \n \nThe young lad obediently moved from his chair and followed him.", "“Where are we going?”\n \n“To my workshop, it’s time I taught you something important,” Anders replied. They didn’t walk a lot, as the workshop was in the kitchen. On top of the round table, there were several ingredients: a big wooden bowl with milk, lemons, vinegar, and a simple colander. Anders smiled, thinking of his younger self.\" Roll up your sleeves, we will be making cheese today.”\n \nGeorge stared at him puzzled. “ Why are we going to make our own, if grandma can bring it from the shop?”\n \nAnders looked at him with a serious, yet calm face. “ I’ve been observing you during lunch. How you throw away the cheese slices in the trash. Your grandmother may be ok with it, but you have to learn how to appreciate what you are given. Those you get from factories and machines won't teach you that. This skill will.\" “But I don’t know how to make cheese.”\n \n“ I will teach you.”\n \nThe two started working.", "Anders rolled up his sleeve and guided George step by step. He had his grandson pour the milk into a bent, but bright-looking pot and heated it until the milk boiled. He had George keep an eye on the pot, while he was reading the newspaper. When the milk started boiling, Anders stirred carefully and added a few tablespoons of vinegar with a pinch of his special ingredient: squeezed lemon juice with a small hint of sugar. The vinegar performed its magic and the cheese soon started separating into curds. “It’s time,” said Anders enthusiastically. He took the large pot and poured the cheese curds into two small colanders, covered with 2 pieces of thick cloth. Anders asked his grandson to observe as he started wrapping the cloth and continued to squeeze it. Afterwards, he was massaging it with his hands and wrapped it into a big circular shape. Finally, he used his favorite weight, an ancient, big copy of the bible. George did the same, and for now they had to wait. “It is time son.", "Unwrap it carefully and we shall cut it.”\n \nBoth unwrapped their cloths and sliced the cheese into four equal pieces. Anders tasted his with a huge grin on his face and was full of satisfaction. He ate it slowly so he could absorb all the flavor. “ Taste it, it’s good,” he said. George took a small bit and unfortunately felt nothing special. “ I guess it’s good.” \n \n“EXCUSEE ME?!? !, ”said his startled grandfather. Both were staring at each other in silence, and Anders had set his plan.", "For every weekend when his grandkids came, he and Georgie would stay and make more cheese, which then they would serve at the table, instead of buying it premade and processed. The young one had slowly found himself eating more and more cheese, as it was included in most of their meals and skills got better with more practice. However, he still hadn’t given up his old habits, and that wasn’t relished by his grandpa. One particular Sunday, as his frustration was higher than ever, George separated himself from the farm, but he was unaware that aside from a cheese-maker, his grandfather was also a master tracker. “ Shouldn’t we be inside by now?,” said Anders with his arms crossed. Georgie had his back behind him. “ I am just enjoying the fresh air.”\n \nThe old man wasn’t buying it. “Turn around then.”\n \nReluctantly, George turned around with his handheld placed between his thighs. Anders slowly snatched it. “ You are not allowed to have this as we work. I am keeping it for now.”\n \nGeorge felt the blood boil in his veins and lashed out at him. “ WHAT’S THE POINT OF THIS GRANDPA?", "This is utterly useless, having me make cheese like this instead of buying it. What are you trying to teach me?”\n \nAnders was shocked at that response and for minutes stared at him motionless. “Let me show you something.”\n \nAnders went inside, left the device, and came back with a hat on his head.", "“ We are going into town.”\n \nThe two took a stroll into town, and it was the first time George was visiting it. They walked down the path towards the farm and took a straight left. Rebecca and her brother never came to this part of town. “ Hey Andy, who is that with you?,” said an old man, outside a bakery. “Morning Greg. He is my grandson Georgie. Georgie said hi to him please.” \n \n“ Mr. Anders. Nice to see you. How’s everything with Marie?”\n \n“Ohh we are arguing about getting a new bench. She wants to read now or something.”\n \nThe two were stopped countless times by Ander’s buddies at their respective shops, but they didn’t come down to chat. It was to observe. Observe the local carpenters coming outside pouring sweat while their partners brought snacks and water. Hear the butcher’s intense snap at the lamb as he cut it into pieces and then wrapped it around carefully. Smell the yummy aroma of freshly baked bread coming out of the oven. In the corners there were certain homeless buggers sitting by the side of some stores. Some owners came outside to sit next to them and hand them food and water. As George turned his head around, he observed a coeval of his, leading the strains of a dirty dunkey, carrying a mother with her baby child. The boy turned to George and smiled at him. The image in front of him was in general gloomy and dirty, yet everyone around him were working hard with a smile on their faces and helped each other. He didn’t notice a trace of technology around him.", "Anders and George decided to come back to the farm and the young one finally broke the tension between them, “ Grandpa, why did you show this?”\n \nThe old geezer turned around him slowly and simply said, “ If I have to tell you,then it was all for nothing.” That was the last thing Anders said to his grandson in weeks. George and his sister would continue to visit their grandparents out of need. Anders would rarely talk to his grandson and he couldn’t prove it but he felt his heart fading in color. Attempts were made to break him out of his shell but to no avail. “What am gonna do?,” George asked himself repeatedly in his room. He stared at the wall for a second and looked back to reflect on the townsfolk that he had observed. They were not in the best conditions, but they worked hard to provide for others, and everybody was grateful for what they produced and received. “THAT’S IT!", "!,” he shouted in excitement. Immediately after, his mother would allow him to use the kitchen as he made his own cheese. He listed in his head all the ingredients as he could remember them, and in the process failed a few several times. “First lower the heat, then mix.”\n \n“Now add this.”\n \nBefore he would attempt his one hundredth try, he decided to add a personal touch to his creation. A few slices of fresh mango and peach. “He is going to love this.\" Then, he finished wrapping it around the cloth and in the morning carried it to the car.", "Although they had driven the same way to the farm, this time the trip felt eternal. He rushed off immediately when the car stopped in front and he ignored his mother's screams. Anders was found in the back of the place organizing his tools. He turned around at the increasing footsteps. \"Grandpa, this is for you,\" said George as he handed him his homemade cheese. Anders unwrapped curiously and his eyes widened in shock of the end result. Not for good reasons tho. George proceeded and told him,\"Take a bite.\" With some hesitation, the old geezer grabbed a small piece and staffed it in his mouth. \" Wow. This tastes terrible.\" George drops his hands in shock. \"But I love it.\" Although the cheese's taste was far from tasty, the struggle and love hidden behind the attempt to make it enlightened his heart to a full. The following weeks, the two spent more time together and George became a regular visitor and friend to the people of the town. He never threw a slice of cheese again in his life."], "summaries": ["In a technologically advanced world, traditional practices and manual work have been replaced, but some individuals in hidden corners still hold onto old customs.", "The grandfather, Old Anders, grows troubled by his grandson George's habit of wasting cheese slices, leading to a mysterious confrontation one afternoon at the farm.", "Anders teaches George the art of making cheese to instill appreciation for homemade products over store-bought ones.", "Anders teaches his grandson George how to make cheese, using a special family recipe.", "Anders and George taste the cheese, leading to contrasting reactions, ultimately setting the stage for Anders's hidden agenda to unfold.", "A grandfather and his grandson bond over making cheese on weekends, but tensions rise when the grandson's habits clash with his grandpa's expectations.

Summer had barely begun and I felt like I was already sweating off my face. I think to some degree even my hair ends had began to spring some liquid, boy was it hot. I guess dad sensed the temperature that’s why he didn’t want me to go out today.", "“You got that right”, Mrs. Malik agreed, “Once you stay cool and stay inside you should be great, you know this much heat isn’t good for your skin dear”. I shook my head as I watched her gingerly walking away and wondered if she ever saw a snack stand inside a house. My Uncle Jules owned quite a few snack stands around town and he needed the extra help. Besides I was being paid, and for that I was glad because it would come in handy for the new scooter I wanted to buy for the next term. There was no way of escaping this heat; I would have done anything for cool breeze at that point. The morning trailed on lazily, just think I could have been at a summer camp somewhere, probably soaking in a lake. It seemed as if nature heard my thoughts from earlier, because just then a cool breeze began to blow. I was grateful for the clouds I saw in the north; maybe it could cover the sun and give my skin a break that would be even better. “Yes this was the stuff”, I said out loud, as I watched the town folk scampering for shade. By three in the afternoon, it seemed like if the town was abuzz, everyone seemed to be... busy.", "Everyone in town was up and down despite of the sun that seemed to have turned up a few degrees; I had started to get curious. “Was I missing something”, I thought. Just then I saw my classmate Mason. “Mason, what’s up”, I asked. “Just going to get some groceries for my mom”, he shrugged. “Where is everyone going”, I asked. “The only time town is this busy is during the Hunchy, Munchy town extravaganza”, I laughed. “The weather report said that there will be a thunderstorm in a few hours or something”, Mason answered. “Ooookkkkk, so what’s so disturbing about a thunderstorm, it’s not like that has never happened before”, I shrugged. “Yeah, but they are expecting a super storm”, he said eyebrows raised. “A super storm” I answered distracted. “Oh, well I guess that is unusual”, I said scratching my head, “But how”. “They said something about super storm cells and cold fronts moving from the arctic, I dunno”, he answered. Just then my cell began to ring, it was dad. “It’s my dad, later Mason”, I said raising my hand to him as he walked away..\n \n“Hey dad”, I answered. “Vanessa pack up and come home now”, he said, in a firm tone.", "“Ok, I’m on it”, I said, as I started to throw stuff under the counter of the snack stand. By nightfall it seemed as if a hurricane was in tow, I had just made it home when the rain began its angry assault to the earth; I blew a sigh of relief. I had tried calling my mom but her phone was switched off, I hoped she was ok.\n \nAs I entered the door I was hit with the newsflash on TV. My dad turned around to look at me; his face was in deep concentration, whatever it was it looked like a hurricane from the news reviews.", "We didn’t get hurricanes and besides why were we not warned before. Luckily it seemed like dad had gone shopping, from all the stuff that was stocked up. “Did you get in contact with mom”, I asked, as the first peal of thunder vibrated off of the windows. “No, her cell is still off and she isn’t at Maurice’s house”, he answered. Ten minutes later, a truck pulled up in front of our house, I watched as my mom jumped haphazardly from her seat, she landed on her butt. “Thanks Trevor”, she shouted out to whoever was driving as she got up and ran towards the house. I hugged her, “I was getting worried, your cell was off”, I said. “Yeah, it died”, she replied as she went to hug my dad. Half an hour later, we listened as the wind kept picking up speed outside and the thunder and lightning seemed to mirror the action. The electricity soon followed and we were left feeling our way in the dark. Fortunately dad seemed to have prepared, so we found everything easily. The rain pounded mercilessly on our house, it would not be pleasant to be caught outside in this storm.", "We had a quiet dinner, except for the ruckus outside and after dinner, I retired to bed, it didn’t seem like the power would return soon enough so I could be updated on the storm. Dad had an old radio though, so he was keeping track of whatever was being reported. Dad was ex-army so he had a backup everything, just in case, sometimes I thought he was paranoid at least that was how he was acting the last couple of weeks. I said good night, as I left my parents sitting on the couch, talking. I had a long day with the work and heat. I fell into bed like a sack of potatoes and put my earphones on music always helped me to sleep comfortably. My next conscious thought was somebody shaking me awake, like what’s with that.", "But before I could respond, I was hit with a brisk temperature. Was it ... cold? I mean thunderstorms sometimes dropped the temperature, but this wasn’t that. “Vanessa, you need to get up”, my dad said as he handed me a thick coat. It was hands down-gut wrenching-ears ringing-toe curlingly cold. “Dad wha-wha-whats happening”, I managed to stutter. He was handing me the entire winter get up. “I can’t say for sure honey, but it seems like we should expect some snow”, he muttered. “How... how is that possible, its sum-summer”, I stuttered, trying to get my teeth to cooperate. I mean I wasn’t a climatologist but even I knew that it’s impossible for snow to fall in the summer unless you lived at some high elevation or something. Dad sighed, I watched as mom walked into the room. “Early last year there were whispers”, my dad began.", "“Whispers of what”, I asked puzzled. “Remember the Kryalisis War a few years ago”, he asked. “Yes everyone does, when the people from Kryalia had the civil war and activated their nuclear sites”, I said. Kryalia was a nation of more that 130 million in Atlantic Ocean, which was closer to Europe. They were leaders in advanced technology and were considered one of the most distinguished nations on planet earth. It was said influences from outside nations created divide among the leaders and people of Kryalia and well you get the picture. A civil war later ensued and someone who had access to the nuclear sites detonated them all. Millions were killed and the surrounding nations were affected, it was basically a waste land today. It happened a little over five years ago, every child knew the story. “Remember they had created a task force to deal with the nuclear exposure from becoming a global catastrophe, they limited the radiation, the soot and nuclear fallout”, he asked indicating on his fingers\n \n“Yes”, I answered nodding; the information had begun to warm me up.", "“What the general population was not aware of, was that another task force had been instituted to trap the radiation and to turn it into renewable energy, because their aim was to create another energy source”, he answered. “That would explain why there wasn’t a great deal of radiation sickness in areas that were being expected”, mom added, “they enclosed it”. “They created some sort of shield”, dad added scratching his head. “That makes no sense, there’s no way they could have known this would happen and to build something in time to trap it would have been impossible”, I said. But the look my father gave me brought me to realization, “Unless they knew that someone was going to activate the nukes instead”. “Bingo”, my dad answered, “Based on what I heard, activation those type of nukes created an endless power supply, that way it could be easily harnessed in that form”. “But these all sound like conspiracy theories, hoaxes made up for fun, dad this can’t be real”, I said, laughing nervously as I looked at my mother, “I mean you can’t get away with something like that, there’s no way somebody can cover that up”. “When money, power and agendas are in agreement, there’s nothing that cannot be done”, he answered. “But all those people, all those lives”, I said in horror, analyzing what I had just heard. Tears sprung to my eyes, this was terrible\n \n“So there were whispers a few weeks ago”, he said again, “that due to global warming and the changing climate and the force from the radiation being exerted on the shields, the machine they built had began to destabilize”.", "“So what does that mean”, I asked, but did I really want to know the answer. “The simplest way I can put it, is a hyperactive nuclear winter” he said. How was it, that no one saw this coming, no reports, no new cast, no nothing about it, I thought. By seven that morning, the snow had began to fall.", "There was no hint of sunlight; it was as dark as the night before. Dad said it was because of the soot from the explosions, it had begun to move in the air currents, and only heaven knew how far it would spread. Worst of all we didn’t know how bad it could get and with events like these there was always some degree of unrest. It wasn’t as if anyone was expecting it to snow. What was going to happen now? Just to think, yesterday I was complaining about the heat and the sun and just look at the difference twenty four hours made. I was bundled up looking through the window as I heard dad nailing down boards, he was boarding up the house. I guess it was a good thing he was a little paranoid. But most of all how ironic it was that snow would fall in summer..."], "summaries": ["As summer began, the intense heat made the protagonist feel like they were sweating profusely, even their hair ends were damp, prompting their dad to advise them to stay indoors.", "As the heat weighed heavily on the town, the protagonist longed for a cool escape, dreaming of a summer camp by a lake, but unexpected events hinted at a shift in the weather and brought with them a sense of anticipation.", "A town is abuzz with activity as residents prepare for an impending super storm, catching the attention of Vanessa who receives a urgent message from her father to pack up and head home immediately.", "Franticly preparing for an impending storm, the protagonist rushes home only to be met with alarming news about a hurricane on the horizon, leaving them worried for their mother's safety and intrigued by their father's mysterious demeanor.", "A family prepares for a storm as the mother returns unexpectedly, just in time before the hurricane hits, leaving them to face the darkness and fury of the storm together.", "During a stormy night, the protagonist falls asleep to music, only to be abruptly woken up by someone shaking them awake.", "Vanessa is baffled by the sudden cold snap in summer and receives clues about an unexpected snowfall from her parents.", "After reminiscing about the Kryalisis War and its devastating aftermath, the mention of a task force tackling nuclear exposure piques their interest.

ELMIRE\n   You hurry so, I hardly can attend you. MADAME PERNELLE\n   Then don't, my daughter-in law. Stay where you are. I can dispense with your polite attentions. ELMIRE\n   We're only paying what is due you, mother. Why must you go away in such a hurry? MADAME PERNELLE\n   Because I can't endure your carryings-on,\n   And no one takes the slightest pains to please me. I leave your house, I tell you, quite disgusted;\n   You do the opposite of my instructions;\n   You've no respect for anything; each one\n   Must have his say; it's perfect pandemonium. DORINE\n   If ...\n \n   MADAME PERNELLE\n   You're a servant wench, my girl, and much\n   Too full of gab, and too impertinent\n   And free with your advice on all occasions. DAMIS\n   But ...\n \n   MADAME PERNELLE\n   You're a fool, my boy--f, o, o, l\n   Just spells your name. Let grandma tell you that\n   I've said a hundred times to my poor son,\n   Your father, that you'd never come to good\n   Or give him anything but plague and torment. MARIANE\n   I think ...\n \n   MADAME PERNELLE\n   O dearie me, his little sister! You're all demureness, butter wouldn't melt\n   In your mouth, one would think to look at you. Still waters, though, they say ... you know the proverb;\n   And I don't like your doings on the sly. ELMIRE\n   But, mother ...\n \n   MADAME PERNELLE\n   Daughter, by your leave, your conduct\n   In everything is altogether wrong;\n   You ought to set a good example for 'em;\n   Their dear departed mother did much better. You are extravagant; and it offends me,\n   To see you always decked out like a princess. A woman who would please her husband's eyes\n   Alone, wants no such wealth of fineries. CLEANTE\n   But, madam, after all ...\n \n   MADAME PERNELLE\n   Sir, as for you,\n   The lady's brother, I esteem you highly,\n   Love and respect you. But, sir, all the same,\n   If I were in my son's, her husband's, place,\n   I'd urgently entreat you not to come\n   Within our doors. You preach a way of living\n   That decent people cannot tolerate. I'm rather frank with you; but that's my way--\n   I don't mince matters, when I mean a thing. DAMIS\n   Mr. Tartuffe, your friend, is mighty lucky ...\n \n   MADAME PERNELLE\n   He is a holy man, and must be heeded;\n   I can't endure, with any show of patience,\n   To hear a scatterbrains like you attack him. DAMIS\n   What! Shall I let a bigot criticaster\n   Come and usurp a tyrant's power here? And shall we never dare amuse ourselves\n   Till this fine gentleman deigns to consent? DORINE\n   If we must hark to him, and heed his maxims,\n   There's not a thing we do but what's a crime;\n   He censures everything, this zealous carper. MADAME PERNELLE\n   And all he censures is well censured, too. He wants to guide you on the way to heaven;\n   My son should train you all to love him well. DAMIS\n   No, madam, look you, nothing--not my father\n   Nor anything--can make me tolerate him. I should belie my feelings not to say so. His actions rouse my wrath at every turn;\n   And I foresee that there must come of it\n   An open rupture with this sneaking scoundrel. DORINE\n   Besides, 'tis downright scandalous to see\n   This unknown upstart master of the house--\n   This vagabond, who hadn't, when he came,\n   Shoes to his feet, or clothing worth six farthings,\n   And who so far forgets his place, as now\n   To censure everything, and rule the roost! MADAME PERNELLE\n   Eh! Mercy sakes alive! Things would go better\n   If all were governed by his pious orders. DORINE\n   He passes for a saint in your opinion. In fact, he's nothing but a hypocrite. MADAME PERNELLE\n   Just listen to her tongue! DORINE\n   I wouldn't trust him,\n   Nor yet his Lawrence, without bonds and surety. MADAME PERNELLE\n   I don't know what the servant's character\n   May be; but I can guarantee the master\n   A holy man. You hate him and reject him\n   Because he tells home truths to all of you. 'Tis sin alone that moves his heart to anger,\n   And heaven's interest is his only motive. DORINE\n   Of course. But why, especially of late,\n   Can he let nobody come near the house? Is heaven offended at a civil call\n   That he should make so great a fuss about it? I'll tell you, if you like, just what I think;\n   (Pointing to Elmire)\n   Upon my word, he's jealous of our mistress. MADAME PERNELLE\n   You hold your tongue, and think what you are saying. He's not alone in censuring these visits;\n   The turmoil that attends your sort of people,\n   Their carriages forever at the door,\n   And all their noisy footmen, flocked together,\n   Annoy the neighbourhood, and raise a scandal. I'd gladly think there's nothing really wrong;\n   But it makes talk; and that's not as it should be. CLEANTE\n   Eh! madam, can you hope to keep folk's tongues\n   From wagging? It would be a grievous thing\n   If, for the fear of idle talk about us,\n   We had to sacrifice our friends. No, no;\n   Even if we could bring ourselves to do it,\n   Think you that everyone would then be silenced? Against backbiting there is no defence\n   So let us try to live in innocence,\n   To silly tattle pay no heed at all,\n   And leave the gossips free to vent their gall. DORINE\n   Our neighbour Daphne, and her little husband,\n   Must be the ones who slander us, I'm thinking. Those whose own conduct's most ridiculous,\n   Are always quickest to speak ill of others;\n   They never fail to seize at once upon\n   The slightest hint of any love affair,\n   And spread the news of it with glee, and give it\n   The character they'd have the world believe in. By others' actions, painted in their colours,\n   They hope to justify their own; they think,\n   In the false hope of some resemblance, either\n   To make their own intrigues seem innocent,\n   Or else to make their neighbours share the blame\n   Which they are loaded with by everybody. MADAME PERNELLE\n   These arguments are nothing to the purpose. Orante, we all know, lives a perfect life;\n   Her thoughts are all of heaven; and I have heard\n   That she condemns the company you keep. DORINE\n   O admirable pattern! Virtuous dame! She lives the model of austerity;\n   But age has brought this piety upon her,\n   And she's a prude, now she can't help herself. As long as she could capture men's attentions\n   She made the most of her advantages;\n   But, now she sees her beauty vanishing,\n   She wants to leave the world, that's leaving her,\n   And in the specious veil of haughty virtue\n   She'd hide the weakness of her worn-out charms. That is the way with all your old coquettes;\n   They find it hard to see their lovers leave 'em;\n   And thus abandoned, their forlorn estate\n   Can find no occupation but a prude's. These pious dames, in their austerity,\n   Must carp at everything, and pardon nothing. They loudly blame their neighbours' way of living,\n   Not for religion's sake, but out of envy,\n   Because they can't endure to see another\n   Enjoy the pleasures age has weaned them from. MADAME PERNELLE (to Elmire)\n   There! That's the kind of rigmarole to please you,\n   Daughter-in-law. One never has a chance\n   To get a word in edgewise, at your house,\n   Because this lady holds the floor all day;\n   But none the less, I mean to have my say, too. I tell you that my son did nothing wiser\n   In all his life, than take this godly man\n   Into his household; heaven sent him here,\n   In your great need, to make you all repent;\n   For your salvation, you must hearken to him;\n   He censures nothing but deserves his censure. These visits, these assemblies, and these balls,\n   Are all inventions of the evil spirit. You never hear a word of godliness\n   At them--but idle cackle, nonsense, flimflam. Our neighbour often comes in for a share,\n   The talk flies fast, and scandal fills the air;\n   It makes a sober person's head go round,\n   At these assemblies, just to hear the sound\n   Of so much gab, with not a word to say;\n   And as a learned man remarked one day\n   Most aptly, 'tis the Tower of Babylon,\n   Where all, beyond all limit, babble on. And just to tell you how this point came in ...\n \n   (To Cleante)\n   So! Now the gentlemen must snicker, must he? Go find fools like yourself to make you laugh\n   And don't ...\n \n   (To Elmire)\n   Daughter, good-bye; not one word more. As for this house, I leave the half unsaid;\n   But I shan't soon set foot in it again,\n \n   (Cuffing Flipotte)\n   Come, you! What makes you dream and stand agape,\n   Hussy! I'll warm your ears in proper shape! March, trollop, march! SCENE II\n \n   CLEANTE, DORINE\n \n \n   CLEANTE\n   I won't escort her down,\n   For fear she might fall foul of me again;\n   The good old lady ...\n \n   DORINE\n   Bless us!", "What a pity\n   She shouldn't hear the way you speak of her! She'd surely tell you you're too \"good\" by half,\n   And that she's not so \"old\" as all that, neither! CLEANTE\n   How she got angry with us all for nothing! And how she seems possessed with her Tartuffe! DORINE\n   Her case is nothing, though, beside her son's! To see him, you would say he's ten times worse! His conduct in our late unpleasantness [1]\n   Had won him much esteem, and proved his courage\n   In service of his king; but now he's like\n   A man besotted, since he's been so taken\n   With this Tartuffe. He calls him brother, loves him\n   A hundred times as much as mother, son,\n   Daughter, and wife. He tells him all his secrets\n   And lets him guide his acts, and rule his conscience. He fondles and embraces him; a sweetheart\n   Could not, I think, be loved more tenderly;\n   At table he must have the seat of honour,\n   While with delight our master sees him eat\n   As much as six men could; we must give up\n   The choicest tidbits to him; if he belches,\n   ('tis a servant speaking) [2]\n   Master exclaims: \"God bless you!\" --Oh, he dotes\n   Upon him! he's his universe, his hero;\n   He's lost in constant admiration, quotes him\n   On all occasions, takes his trifling acts\n   For wonders, and his words for oracles. The fellow knows his dupe, and makes the most on't,\n   He fools him with a hundred masks of virtue,\n   Gets money from him all the time by canting,\n   And takes upon himself to carp at us. Even his silly coxcomb of a lackey\n   Makes it his business to instruct us too;\n   He comes with rolling eyes to preach at us,\n   And throws away our ribbons, rouge, and patches. The wretch, the other day, tore up a kerchief\n   That he had found, pressed in the _Golden Legend_,\n   Calling it a horrid crime for us to mingle\n   The devil's finery with holy things. [Footnote 1: Referring to the rebellion called La Fronde, during the\n   minority of Louis XIV.] [Footnote 2: Moliere's note, inserted in the text of all the old\n   editions. It is a curious illustration of the desire for uniformity\n   and dignity of style in dramatic verse of the seventeenth century,\n   that Moliere feels called on to apologize for a touch of realism like\n   this. Indeed, these lines were even omitted when the play was given.] SCENE III\n \n   ELMIRE, MARIANE, DAMIS, CLEANTE, DORINE\n \n \n   ELMIRE (to Cleante)\n   You're very lucky to have missed the speech\n   She gave us at the door. I see my husband\n   Is home again. He hasn't seen me yet,\n   So I'll go up and wait till he comes in. CLEANTE\n   And I, to save time, will await him here;\n   I'll merely say good-morning, and be gone. SCENE IV\n \n   CLEANTE, DAMIS, DORINE\n \n   DAMIS\n   I wish you'd say a word to him about\n   My sister's marriage; I suspect Tartuffe\n   Opposes it, and puts my father up\n   To all these wretched shifts. You know, besides,\n   How nearly I'm concerned in it myself;\n   If love unites my sister and Valere,\n   I love his sister too; and if this marriage\n   Were to ...\n \n   DORINE\n   He's coming. SCENE V\n \n   ORGON, CLEANTE, DORINE\n \n \n   ORGON\n   Ah! Good morning, brother. CLEANTE\n   I was just going, but am glad to greet you. Things are not far advanced yet, in the country? ORGON\n   Dorine ...\n \n   (To Cleante)\n   Just wait a bit, please, brother-in-law. Let me allay my first anxiety\n   By asking news about the family. (To Dorine)\n   Has everything gone well these last two days? What's happening? And how is everybody? DORINE\n   Madam had fever, and a splitting headache\n   Day before yesterday, all day and evening. ORGON\n   And how about Tartuffe? DORINE\n   Tartuffe? He's well;\n   He's mighty well; stout, fat, fair, rosy-lipped. ORGON\n   Poor man! DORINE\n   At evening she had nausea\n   And couldn't touch a single thing for supper,\n   Her headache still was so severe. ORGON\n   And how\n   About Tartuffe? DORINE\n   He supped alone, before her,\n   And unctuously ate up two partridges,\n   As well as half a leg o' mutton, deviled. ORGON\n   Poor man! DORINE\n   All night she couldn't get a wink\n   Of sleep, the fever racked her so; and we\n   Had to sit up with her till daylight. ORGON\n   How\n   About Tartuffe? DORINE\n   Gently inclined to slumber,\n   He left the table, went into his room,\n   Got himself straight into a good warm bed,\n   And slept quite undisturbed until next morning. ORGON\n   Poor man! DORINE\n   At last she let us all persuade her,\n   And got up courage to be bled; and then\n   She was relieved at once. ORGON\n   And how about\n   Tartuffe? DORINE\n   He plucked up courage properly,\n   Bravely entrenched his soul against all evils,\n   And to replace the blood that she had lost,\n   He drank at breakfast four huge draughts of wine. ORGON\n   Poor man! DORINE\n   So now they both are doing well;\n   And I'll go straightway and inform my mistress\n   How pleased you are at her recovery. SCENE VI\n \n   ORGON, CLEANTE\n \n \n   CLEANTE\n   Brother, she ridicules you to your face;\n   And I, though I don't want to make you angry,\n   Must tell you candidly that she's quite right.", "Was such infatuation ever heard of? And can a man to-day have charms to make you\n   Forget all else, relieve his poverty,\n   Give him a home, and then ... ? ORGON\n   Stop there, good brother,\n   You do not know the man you're speaking of. CLEANTE\n   Since you will have it so, I do not know him;\n   But after all, to tell what sort of man\n   He is ...\n \n   ORGON\n   Dear brother, you'd be charmed to know him;\n   Your raptures over him would have no end. He is a man ... who ... ah! ... in fact ...a man\n   Whoever does his will, knows perfect peace,\n   And counts the whole world else, as so much dung. His converse has transformed me quite; he weans\n   My heart from every friendship, teaches me\n   To have no love for anything on earth;\n   And I could see my brother, children, mother,\n   And wife, all die, and never care--a snap. CLEANTE\n   Your feelings are humane, I must say, brother! ORGON\n   Ah! If you'd seen him, as I saw him first,\n   You would have loved him just as much as I. He came to church each day, with contrite mien,\n   Kneeled, on both knees, right opposite my place,\n   And drew the eyes of all the congregation,\n   To watch the fervour of his prayers to heaven;\n   With deep-drawn sighs and great ejaculations,\n   He humbly kissed the earth at every moment;\n   And when I left the church, he ran before me\n   To give me holy water at the door. I learned his poverty, and who he was,\n   By questioning his servant, who is like him,\n   And gave him gifts; but in his modesty\n   He always wanted to return a part. \"It is too much,\" he'd say, \"too much by half;\n   I am not worthy of your pity.\" Then,\n   When I refused to take it back, he'd go,\n   Before my eyes, and give it to the poor. At length heaven bade me take him to my home,\n   And since that day, all seems to prosper here. He censures everything, and for my sake\n   He even takes great interest in my wife;\n   He lets me know who ogles her, and seems\n   Six times as jealous as I am myself. You'd not believe how far his zeal can go:\n   He calls himself a sinner just for trifles;\n   The merest nothing is enough to shock him;\n   So much so, that the other day I heard him\n   Accuse himself for having, while at prayer,\n   In too much anger caught and killed a flea. CLEANTE\n   Zounds, brother, you are mad, I think! Or else\n   You're making sport of me, with such a speech. What are you driving at with all this nonsense ... ? ORGON\n   Brother, your language smacks of atheism;\n   And I suspect your soul's a little tainted\n   Therewith. I've preached to you a score of times\n   That you'll draw down some judgment on your head. CLEANTE\n   That is the usual strain of all your kind;\n   They must have every one as blind as they. They call you atheist if you have good eyes;\n   And if you don't adore their vain grimaces,\n   You've neither faith nor care for sacred things. No, no; such talk can't frighten me; I know\n   What I am saying; heaven sees my heart. We're not the dupes of all your canting mummers;\n   There are false heroes--and false devotees;\n   And as true heroes never are the ones\n   Who make much noise about their deeds of honour,\n   Just so true devotees, whom we should follow,\n   Are not the ones who make so much vain show. What! Will you find no difference between\n   Hypocrisy and genuine devoutness? And will you treat them both alike, and pay\n   The self-same honour both to masks and faces\n   Set artifice beside sincerity,\n   Confuse the semblance with reality,\n   Esteem a phantom like a living person,\n   And counterfeit as good as honest coin? Men, for the most part, are strange creatures, truly! You never find them keep the golden mean;\n   The limits of good sense, too narrow for them,\n   Must always be passed by, in each direction;\n   They often spoil the noblest things, because\n   They go too far, and push them to extremes. I merely say this by the way, good brother. ORGON\n   You are the sole expounder of the doctrine;\n   Wisdom shall die with you, no doubt, good brother,\n   You are the only wise, the sole enlightened,\n   The oracle, the Cato, of our age. All men, compared to you, are downright fools. CLEANTE\n   I'm not the sole expounder of the doctrine,\n   And wisdom shall not die with me, good brother. But this I know, though it be all my knowledge,\n   That there's a difference 'twixt false and true. And as I find no kind of hero more\n   To be admired than men of true religion,\n   Nothing more noble or more beautiful\n   Than is the holy zeal of true devoutness;\n   Just so I think there's naught more odious\n   Than whited sepulchres of outward unction,\n   Those barefaced charlatans, those hireling zealots,\n   Whose sacrilegious, treacherous pretence\n   Deceives at will, and with impunity\n   Makes mockery of all that men hold sacred;\n   Men who, enslaved to selfish interests,\n   Make trade and merchandise of godliness,\n   And try to purchase influence and office\n   With false eye-rollings and affected raptures;\n   Those men, I say, who with uncommon zeal\n   Seek their own fortunes on the road to heaven;\n   Who, skilled in prayer, have always much to ask,\n   And live at court to preach retirement;\n   Who reconcile religion with their vices,\n   Are quick to anger, vengeful, faithless, tricky,\n   And, to destroy a man, will have the boldness\n   To call their private grudge the cause of heaven;\n   All the more dangerous, since in their anger\n   They use against us weapons men revere,\n   And since they make the world applaud their passion,\n   And seek to stab us with a sacred sword. There are too many of this canting kind. Still, the sincere are easy to distinguish;\n   And many splendid patterns may be found,\n   In our own time, before our very eyes\n   Look at Ariston, Periandre, Oronte,\n   Alcidamas, Clitandre, and Polydore;\n   No one denies their claim to true religion;\n   Yet they're no braggadocios of virtue,\n   They do not make insufferable display,\n   And their religion's human, tractable;\n   They are not always judging all our actions,\n   They'd think such judgment savoured of presumption;\n   And, leaving pride of words to other men,\n   'Tis by their deeds alone they censure ours. Evil appearances find little credit\n   With them; they even incline to think the best\n   Of others. No caballers, no intriguers,\n   They mind the business of their own right living. They don't attack a sinner tooth and nail,\n   For sin's the only object of their hatred;\n   Nor are they over-zealous to attempt\n   Far more in heaven's behalf than heaven would have 'em. That is my kind of man, that is true living,\n   That is the pattern we should set ourselves. Your fellow was not fashioned on this model;\n   You're quite sincere in boasting of his zeal;\n   But you're deceived, I think, by false pretences. ORGON\n   My dear good brother-in-law, have you quite done? CLEANTE\n   Yes. ORGON\n   I'm your humble servant. (Starts to go.) CLEANTE\n   Just a word. We'll drop that other subject. But you know\n   Valere has had the promise of your daughter. ORGON\n   Yes. CLEANTE\n   You had named the happy day. ORGON\n   'Tis true. CLEANTE\n   Then why put off the celebration of it? ORGON\n   I can't say. CLEANTE\n   Can you have some other plan\n   In mind? ORGON\n   Perhaps. CLEANTE\n   You mean to break your word? ORGON\n   I don't say that. CLEANTE\n   I hope no obstacle\n   Can keep you from performing what you've promised. ORGON\n   Well, that depends. CLEANTE\n   Why must you beat about? Valere has sent me here to settle matters. ORGON\n   Heaven be praised! CLEANTE\n   What answer shall I take him? ORGON\n   Why, anything you please. CLEANTE\n   But we must know\n   Your plans. What are they? ORGON\n   I shall do the will\n   Of Heaven. CLEANTE\n   Come, be serious. You've given\n   Your promise to Valere. Now will you keep it? ORGON\n   Good-bye. CLEANTE (alone)\n   His love, methinks, has much to fear;\n   I must go let him know what's happening here. ACT II   SCENE I\n \n   ORGON, MARIANE\n \n \n   ORGON\n   Now, Mariane.", "MARIANE\n   Yes, father? ORGON\n   Come; I'll tell you\n   A secret. MARIANE\n   Yes ... What are you looking for? ORGON (looking into a small closet-room)\n   To see there's no one there to spy upon us;\n   That little closet's mighty fit to hide in. There! We're all right now. Mariane, in you\n   I've always found a daughter dutiful\n   And gentle. So I've always love you dearly. MARIANE\n   I'm grateful for your fatherly affection. ORGON\n   Well spoken, daughter. Now, prove you deserve it\n   By doing as I wish in all respects. MARIANE\n   To do so is the height of my ambition. ORGON\n   Excellent well. What say you of--Tartuffe? MARIANE\n   Who? I? ORGON\n   Yes, you. Look to it how you answer. MARIANE\n   Why! I'll say of him--anything you please. SCENE II\n \n   ORGON, MARIANE, DORINE (coming in quietly and standing behind\n   Orgon, so that he does not see her)\n \n \n   ORGON\n   Well spoken. A good girl. Say then, my daughter,\n   That all his person shines with noble merit,\n   That he has won your heart, and you would like\n   To have him, by my choice, become your husband. Eh? MARIANE\n   Eh? ORGON\n   What say you? MARIANE\n   Please, what did you say? ORGON\n   What? MARIANE\n   Surely I mistook you, sir? ORGON\n   How now? MARIANE\n   Who is it, father, you would have me say\n   Has won my heart, and I would like to have\n   Become my husband, by your choice? ORGON\n   Tartuffe. MARIANE\n   But, father, I protest it isn't true! Why should you make me tell this dreadful lie? ORGON\n   Because I mean to have it be the truth. Let this suffice for you: I've settled it. MARIANE\n   What, father, you would ... ? ORGON\n   Yes, child, I'm resolved\n   To graft Tartuffe into my family. So he must be your husband. That I've settled. And since your duty ..\n \n   (Seeing Dorine)\n   What are you doing there? Your curiosity is keen, my girl,\n   To make you come eavesdropping on us so. DORINE\n   Upon my word, I don't know how the rumour\n   Got started--if 'twas guess-work or mere chance\n   But I had heard already of this match,\n   And treated it as utter stuff and nonsense. ORGON\n   What! Is the thing incredible? DORINE\n   So much so\n   I don't believe it even from yourself, sir. ORGON\n   I know a way to make you credit it. DORINE\n   No, no, you're telling us a fairly tale! ORGON\n   I'm telling you just what will happen shortly. DORINE\n   Stuff! ORGON\n   Daughter, what I say is in good earnest. DORINE\n   There, there, don't take your father seriously;\n   He's fooling. ORGON\n   But I tell you ...\n \n   DORINE\n   No. No use. They won't believe you. ORGON\n   If I let my anger ...\n \n   DORINE\n   Well, then, we do believe you; and the worse\n   For you it is. What! Can a grown-up man\n   With that expanse of beard across his face\n   Be mad enough to want ...? ORGON\n   You hark me:\n   You've taken on yourself here in this house\n   A sort of free familiarity\n   That I don't like, I tell you frankly, girl. DORINE\n   There, there, let's not get angry, sir, I beg you. But are you making game of everybody? Your daughter's not cut out for bigot's meat;\n   And he has more important things to think of. Besides, what can you gain by such a match? How can a man of wealth, like you, go choose\n   A wretched vagabond for son-in-law? ORGON\n   You hold your tongue. And know, the less he has,\n   The better cause have we to honour him. His poverty is honest poverty;\n   It should exalt him more than worldly grandeur,\n   For he has let himself be robbed of all,\n   Through careless disregard of temporal things\n   And fixed attachment to the things eternal. My help may set him on his feet again,\n   Win back his property--a fair estate\n   He has at home, so I'm informed--and prove him\n   For what he is, a true-born gentleman. DORINE\n   Yes, so he says himself. Such vanity\n   But ill accords with pious living, sir. The man who cares for holiness alone\n   Should not so loudly boast his name and birth;\n   The humble ways of genuine devoutness\n   Brook not so much display of earthly pride. Why should he be so vain? ... But I offend you:\n   Let's leave his rank, then,--take the man himself:\n   Can you without compunction give a man\n   Like him possession of a girl like her? Think what a scandal's sure to come of it! Virtue is at the mercy of the fates,\n   When a girl's married to a man she hates;\n   The best intent to live an honest woman\n   Depends upon the husband's being human,\n   And men whose brows are pointed at afar\n   May thank themselves their wives are what they are. For to be true is more than woman can,\n   With husbands built upon a certain plan;\n   And he who weds his child against her will\n   Owes heaven account for it, if she do ill. Think then what perils wait on your design. ORGON (to Mariane)\n   So! I must learn what's what from her, you see! DORINE\n   You might do worse than follow my advice. ORGON\n   Daughter, we can't waste time upon this nonsense;\n   I know what's good for you, and I'm your father. True, I had promised you to young Valere;\n   But, first, they tell me he's inclined to gamble,\n   And then, I fear his faith is not quite sound. I haven't noticed that he's regular\n   At church. DORINE\n   You'd have him run there just when you do. Like those who go on purpose to be seen? ORGON\n   I don't ask your opinion on the matter. In short, the other is in Heaven's best graces,\n   And that is riches quite beyond compare. This match will bring you every joy you long for;\n   'Twill be all steeped in sweetness and delight. You'll live together, in your faithful loves,\n   Like two sweet children, like two turtle-doves;\n   You'll never fail to quarrel, scold, or tease,\n   And you may do with him whate'er you please. DORINE\n   With him? Do naught but give him horns, I'll warrant. ORGON\n   Out on thee, wench! DORINE\n   I tell you he's cut out for't;\n   However great your daughter's virtue, sir,\n   His destiny is sure to prove the stronger. ORGON\n   Have done with interrupting. Hold your tongue. Don't poke your nose in other people's business. DORINE (She keeps interrupting him, just as he turns and starts\n   to speak to his daughter). If I make bold, sir, 'tis for your own good. ORGON\n   You're too officious; pray you, hold your tongue. DORINE\n   'Tis love of you ...\n \n   ORGON\n   I want none of your love. DORINE\n   Then I will love you in your own despite. ORGON\n   You will, eh? DORINE\n   Yes, your honour's dear to me;\n   I can't endure to see you made the butt\n   Of all men's ridicule. ORGON\n   Won't you be still? DORINE\n   'Twould be a sin to let you make this match. ORGON\n   Won't you be still, I say, you impudent viper! DORINE\n   What! you are pious, and you lose your temper? ORGON\n   I'm all wrought up, with your confounded nonsense;\n   Now, once for all, I tell you hold your tongue. DORINE\n   Then mum's the word; I'll take it out in thinking. ORGON\n   Think all you please; but not a syllable\n   To me about it, or ... you understand! (Turning to his daughter.) As a wise father, I've considered all\n   With due deliberation. DORINE\n   I'll go mad\n   If I can't speak. (She stops the instant he turns his head.) ORGON\n   Though he's no lady's man,\n   Tartuffe is well enough ...\n \n   DORINE\n   A pretty phiz! ORGON\n   So that, although you may not care at all\n   For his best qualities ...\n \n   DORINE\n   A handsome dowry! (Orgon turns and stands in front of her, with arms folded, eyeing\n   her.) Were I in her place, any man should rue it\n   Who married me by force, that's mighty certain;\n   I'd let him know, and that within a week,\n   A woman's vengeance isn't far to seek. ORGON (to Dorine)\n   So--nothing that I say has any weight? DORINE\n   Eh? What's wrong now? I didn't speak to you. ORGON\n   What were you doing? DORINE\n   Talking to myself. ORGON\n   Oh! Very well. (Aside.) Her monstrous impudence\n   Must be chastised with one good slap in the face. (He stands ready to strike her, and, each time he speaks to his\n   daughter, he glances toward her; but she stands still and says not a\n   word.) [3]\n \n   [Footnote 3: As given at the Comedie francaise, the action is as\n   follows: While Orgon says, \"You must approve of my design,\" Dorine is\n   making signs to Mariane to resist his orders; Orgon turns around\n   suddenly; but Dorine quickly changes her gesture and with the hand\n   which she had lifted calmly arranges her hair and her cap. Orgon goes\n   on, \"Think of the husband ...\" and stops before the middle of his\n   sentence to turn and catch the beginning of Dorine's gesture; but he\n   is too quick this time, and Dorine stands looking at his furious\n   countenance with a sweet and gentle expression. He turns and goes on,\n   and the obstinate Dorine again lifts her hand behind his shoulder to\n   urge Mariane to resistance: this time he catches her; but just as he\n   swings his shoulder to give her the promised blow, she stops him by\n   changing the intent of her gesture, and carefully picking from the top\n   of his sleeve a bit of fluff which she holds carefully between her\n   fingers, then blows into the air, and watches intently as it floats\n   away. Orgon is paralysed by her innocence of expression, and compelled\n   to hide his rage.--Regnier, _Le Tartuffe des Comediens_.] ORGON\n   Daughter, you must approve of my design.... Think of this husband ... I have chosen for you...\n \n   (To Dorine)\n   Why don't you talk to yourself? DORINE\n   Nothing to say. ORGON\n   One little word more. DORINE\n   Oh, no, thanks. Not now. ORGON\n   Sure, I'd have caught you. DORINE\n   Faith, I'm no such fool. ORGON\n   So, daughter, now obedience is the word;\n   You must accept my choice with reverence. DORINE (running away)\n   You'd never catch me marrying such a creature. ORGON (swinging his hand at her and missing her)\n   Daughter, you've such a pestilent hussy there\n   I can't live with her longer, without sin. I can't discuss things in the state I'm in. My mind's so flustered by her insolent talk,\n   To calm myself, I must go take a walk. SCENE III\n \n   MARIANE, DORINE\n \n \n   DORINE\n   Say, have you lost the tongue from out your head?", "And must I speak your role from A to Zed? You let them broach a project that's absurd,\n   And don't oppose it with a single word! MARIANE\n   What can I do? My father is the master. DORINE\n   Do? Everything, to ward off such disaster. MARIANE\n   But what? DORINE\n   Tell him one doesn't love by proxy;\n   Tell him you'll marry for yourself, not him;\n   Since you're the one for whom the thing is done,\n   You are the one, not he, the man must please;\n   If his Tartuffe has charmed him so, why let him\n   Just marry him himself--no one will hinder. MARIANE\n   A father's rights are such, it seems to me,\n   That I could never dare to say a word. DORINE\n   Came, talk it out. Valere has asked your hand:\n   Now do you love him, pray, or do you not? MARIANE\n   Dorine! How can you wrong my love so much,\n   And ask me such a question? Have I not\n   A hundred times laid bare my heart to you? Do you know how ardently I love him? DORINE\n   How do I know if heart and words agree,\n   And if in honest truth you really love him? MARIANE\n   Dorine, you wrong me greatly if you doubt it;\n   I've shown my inmost feelings, all too plainly. DORINE\n   So then, you love him? MARIANE\n   Yes, devotedly. DORINE\n   And he returns your love, apparently? MARIANE\n   I think so. DORINE\n   And you both alike are eager\n   To be well married to each other? MARIANE\n   Surely. DORINE\n   Then what's your plan about this other match? MARIANE\n   To kill myself, if it is forced upon me. DORINE\n   Good! That's a remedy I hadn't thought of. Just die, and everything will be all right. This medicine is marvellous, indeed! It drives me mad to hear folk talk such nonsense. MARIANE\n   Oh dear, Dorine you get in such a temper! You have no sympathy for people's troubles. DORINE\n   I have no sympathy when folk talk nonsense,\n   And flatten out as you do, at a pinch. MARIANE\n   But what can you expect?--if one is timid?--\n \n   DORINE\n   But what is love worth, if it has no courage? MARIANE\n   Am I not constant in my love for him? Is't not his place to win me from my father? DORINE\n   But if your father is a crazy fool,\n   And quite bewitched with his Tartuffe? And breaks\n   His bounden word? Is that your lover's fault? MARIANE\n   But shall I publicly refuse and scorn\n   This match, and make it plain that I'm in love? Shall I cast off for him, whate'er he be,\n   Womanly modesty and filial duty? You ask me to display my love in public ... ? DORINE\n   No, no, I ask you nothing. You shall be\n   Mister Tartuffe's; why, now I think of it,\n   I should be wrong to turn you from this marriage. What cause can I have to oppose your wishes? So fine a match! An excellent good match! Mister Tartuffe! Oh ho! No mean proposal! Mister Tartuffe, sure, take it all in all,\n   Is not a man to sneeze at--oh, by no means! 'Tis no small luck to be his happy spouse. The whole world joins to sing his praise already;\n   He's noble--in his parish; handsome too;\n   Red ears and high complexion--oh, my lud! You'll be too happy, sure, with him for husband. MARIANE\n   Oh dear! ...\n \n   DORINE\n   What joy and pride will fill your heart\n   To be the bride of such a handsome fellow! MARIANE\n   Oh, stop, I beg you; try to find some way\n   To help break off the match. I quite give in,\n   I'm ready to do anything you say. DORINE\n   No, no, a daughter must obey her father,\n   Though he should want to make her wed a monkey. Besides, your fate is fine. What could be better! You'll take the stage-coach to his little village,\n   And find it full of uncles and of cousins,\n   Whose conversation will delight you. Then\n   You'll be presented in their best society. You'll even go to call, by way of welcome,\n   On Mrs. Bailiff, Mrs. Tax-Collector,\n   Who'll patronise you with a folding-stool. There, once a year, at carnival, you'll have\n   Perhaps--a ball; with orchestra--two bag-pipes;\n   And sometimes a trained ape, and Punch and Judy;\n   Though if your husband ...\n \n   MARIANE\n   Oh, you'll kill me. Please\n   Contrive to help me out with your advice. DORINE\n   I thank you kindly. MARIANE\n   Oh! Dorine, I beg you ...\n \n   DORINE\n   To serve you right, this marriage must go through. MARIANE\n   Dear girl! DORINE\n   No. MARIANE\n   If I say I love Valere ...\n \n   DORINE\n   No, no. Tartuffe's your man, and you shall taste him. MARIANE\n   You know I've always trusted you; now help me ...\n \n   DORINE\n   No, you shall be, my faith! Tartuffified. MARIANE\n   Well, then, since you've no pity for my fate\n   Let me take counsel only of despair;\n   It will advise and help and give me courage;\n   There's one sure cure, I know, for all my troubles. (She starts to go.) DORINE\n   There, there! Come back. I can't be angry long. I must take pity on you, after all. MARIANE\n   Oh, don't you see, Dorine, if I must bear\n   This martyrdom, I certainly shall die. DORINE\n   Now don't you fret. We'll surely find some way. To hinder this ... But here's Valere, your lover. SCENE IV\n \n   VALERE, MARIANE, DORINE\n \n \n   VALERE\n   Madam, a piece of news--quite new to me--\n   Has just come out, and very fine it is.", "MARIANE\n   What piece of news? VALERE\n   Your marriage with Tartuffe. MARIANE\n   'Tis true my father has this plan in mind. VALERE\n   Your father, madam ...\n \n   MARIANE\n   Yes, he's changed his plans,\n   And did but now propose it to me. VALERE\n   What! Seriously? MARIANE\n   Yes, he was serious,\n   And openly insisted on the match. VALERE\n   And what's your resolution in the matter,\n   Madam? MARIANE\n   I don't know. VALERE\n   That's a pretty answer. You don't know? MARIANE\n   No. VALERE\n   No? MARIANE\n   What do you advise? VALERE\n   I? My advice is, marry him, by all means. MARIANE\n   That's your advice? VALERE\n   Yes. MARIANE\n   Do you mean it? VALERE\n   Surely. A splendid choice, and worthy of your acceptance. MARIANE\n   Oh, very well, sir! I shall take your counsel. VALERE\n   You'll find no trouble taking it, I warrant. MARIANE\n   No more than you did giving it, be sure. VALERE\n   I gave it, truly, to oblige you, madam. MARIANE\n   And I shall take it to oblige you, sir. Dorine (withdrawing to the back of the stage)\n   Let's see what this affair will come to. VALERE\n   So,\n   That is your love? And it was all deceit\n   When you ...\n \n   MARIANE\n   I beg you, say no more of that. You told me, squarely, sir, I should accept\n   The husband that is offered me; and I\n   Will tell you squarely that I mean to do so,\n   Since you have given me this good advice. VALERE\n   Don't shield yourself with talk of my advice. You had your mind made up, that's evident;\n   And now you're snatching at a trifling pretext\n   To justify the breaking of your word. MARIANE\n   Exactly so. VALERE\n   Of course it is; your heart\n   Has never known true love for me. MARIANE\n   Alas! You're free to think so, if you please. VALERE\n   Yes, yes,\n   I'm free to think so; and my outraged love\n   May yet forestall you in your perfidy,\n   And offer elsewhere both my heart and hand. MARIANE\n   No doubt of it; the love your high deserts\n   May win ...\n \n   VALERE\n   Good Lord, have done with my deserts! I know I have but few, and you have proved it. But I may find more kindness in another;\n   I know of someone, who'll not be ashamed\n   To take your leavings, and make up my loss. MARIANE\n   The loss is not so great; you'll easily\n   Console yourself completely for this change. VALERE\n   I'll try my best, that you may well believe. When we're forgotten by a woman's heart,\n   Our pride is challenged; we, too, must forget;\n   Or if we cannot, must at least pretend to. No other way can man such baseness prove,\n   As be a lover scorned, and still in love. MARIANE\n   In faith, a high and noble sentiment. VALERE\n   Yes; and it's one that all men must approve. What! Would you have me keep my love alive,\n   And see you fly into another's arms\n   Before my very eyes; and never offer\n   To someone else the heart that you had scorned? MARIANE\n   Oh, no, indeed! For my part, I could wish\n   That it were done already. VALERE\n   What! You wish it? MARIANE\n   Yes. VALERE\n   This is insult heaped on injury;\n   I'll go at once and do as you desire. (He takes a step or two as if to go away.) MARIANE\n   Oh, very well then. VALERE (turning back)\n   But remember this. 'Twas you that drove me to this desperate pass. MARIANE\n   Of course. VALERE (turning back again)\n   And in the plan that I have formed\n   I only follow your example. MARIANE\n   Yes. VALERE (at the door)\n   Enough; you shall be punctually obeyed. MARIANE\n   So much the better. VALERE (coming back again)\n   This is once for all. MARIANE\n   So be it, then. VALERE (He goes toward the door, but just as he reaches it, turns\n   around)\n   Eh? MARIANE\n   What? VALERE\n   You didn't call me? MARIANE\n   I? You are dreaming. VALERE\n   Very well, I'm gone. Madam, farewell. (He walks slowly away.) MARIANE\n   Farewell, sir. DORINE\n   I must say\n   You've lost your senses and both gone clean daft! I've let you fight it out to the end o' the chapter\n   To see how far the thing could go. Oho, there,\n   Mister Valere! (She goes and seizes him by the arm, to stop him. He makes a great\n   show of resistance.) VALERE\n   What do you want, Dorine? DORINE\n   Come here. VALERE\n   No, no, I'm quite beside myself. Don't hinder me from doing as she wishes. DORINE\n   Stop! VALERE\n   No. You see, I'm fixed, resolved, determined. DORINE\n   So! MARIANE (aside)\n   Since my presence pains him, makes him go,\n   I'd better go myself, and leave him free. DORINE (leaving Valere, and running after Mariane)\n   Now t'other! Where are you going? MARIANE\n   Let me be. DORINE. Come back. MARIANE\n   No, no, it isn't any use. VALERE (aside)\n   'Tis clear the sight of me is torture to her;\n   No doubt, t'were better I should free her from it. DORINE (leaving Mariane and running after Valere)\n   Same thing again! Deuce take you both, I say. Now stop your fooling; come here, you; and you. (She pulls first one, then the other, toward the middle of the stage.) VALERE (to Dorine)\n   What's your idea? MARIANE (to Dorine)\n   What can you mean to do? DORINE\n   Set you to rights, and pull you out o' the scrape. (To Valere)\n   Are you quite mad, to quarrel with her now? VALERE\n   Didn't you hear the things she said to me? DORINE (to Mariane)\n   Are you quite mad, to get in such a passion? MARIANE\n   Didn't you see the way he treated me? DORINE\n   Fools, both of you. (To Valere)\n   She thinks of nothing else\n   But to keep faith with you, I vouch for it. (To Mariane)\n   And he loves none but you, and longs for nothing\n   But just to marry you, I stake my life on't. MARIANE (to Valere)\n   Why did you give me such advice then, pray? VALERE (to Mariane)\n   Why ask for my advice on such a matter? DORINE\n   You both are daft, I tell you. Here, your hands. (To Valere)\n   Come, yours. VALERE (giving Dorine his hand)\n   What for? DORINE (to Mariane)\n   Now, yours. MARIANE (giving Dorine her hand)\n   But what's the use? DORINE\n   Oh, quick now, come along. There, both of you--\n   You love each other better than you think. (Valere and Mariane hold each other's hands some time without looking\n   at each other.) VALERE (at last turning toward Mariane)\n   Come, don't be so ungracious now about it;\n   Look at a man as if you didn't hate him. (Mariane looks sideways toward Valere, with just a bit of a smile.) DORINE\n   My faith and troth, what fools these lovers be! VALERE (to Mariane)\n   But come now, have I not a just complaint? And truly, are you not a wicked creature\n   To take delight in saying what would pain me? MARIANE\n   And are you not yourself the most ungrateful ... ? DORINE\n   Leave this discussion till another time;\n   Now, think how you'll stave off this plaguy marriage. MARIANE\n   Then tell us how to go about it. DORINE\n   Well,\n   We'll try all sorts of ways. (To Mariane)\n   Your father's daft;\n \n   (To Valere)\n   This plan is nonsense. (To Mariane)\n   You had better humour\n   His notions by a semblance of consent,\n   So that in case of danger, you can still\n   Find means to block the marriage by delay. If you gain time, the rest is easy, trust me. One day you'll fool them with a sudden illness,\n   Causing delay; another day, ill omens:\n   You've met a funeral, or broke a mirror,\n   Or dreamed of muddy water. Best of all,\n   They cannot marry you to anyone\n   Without your saying yes. But now, methinks,\n   They mustn't find you chattering together. (To Valere)\n   You, go at once and set your friends at work\n   To make him keep his word to you; while we\n   Will bring the brother's influence to bear,\n   And get the step-mother on our side, too. Good-bye. VALERE (to Mariane)\n   Whatever efforts we may make,\n   My greatest hope, be sure, must rest on you. MARIANE (to Valere)\n   I cannot answer for my father's whims;\n   But no one save Valere shall ever have me. VALERE\n   You thrill me through with joy! Whatever comes ...\n \n   DORINE\n   Oho! These lovers! Never done with prattling! Now go. VALERE (starting to go, and coming back again)\n   One last word ...\n \n   DORINE\n   What a gabble and pother! Be off! By this door, you. And you, by t'other. (She pushes them off, by the shoulders, in opposite directions.) ACT III     SCENE I\n \n   DAMIS, DORINE\n \n \n   DAMIS\n   May lightning strike me dead this very instant,\n   May I be everywhere proclaimed a scoundrel,\n   If any reverence or power shall stop me,\n   And if I don't do straightway something desperate!", "DORINE\n   I beg you, moderate this towering passion;\n   Your father did but merely mention it. Not all things that are talked of turn to facts;\n   The road is long, sometimes, from plans to acts. DAMIS\n   No, I must end this paltry fellow's plots,\n   And he shall hear from me a truth or two. DORINE\n   So ho! Go slow now. Just you leave the fellow--\n   Your father too--in your step-mother's hands. She has some influence with this Tartuffe,\n   He makes a point of heeding all she says,\n   And I suspect that he is fond of her. Would God 'twere true!--'Twould be the height of humour\n   Now, she has sent for him, in your behalf,\n   To sound him on this marriage, to find out\n   What his ideas are, and to show him plainly\n   What troubles he may cause, if he persists\n   In giving countenance to this design. His man says, he's at prayers, I mustn't see him,\n   But likewise says, he'll presently be down. So off with you, and let me wait for him. DAMIS\n   I may be present at this interview. DORINE\n   No, no! They must be left alone. DAMIS\n   I won't\n   So much as speak to him. DORINE\n   Go on! We know you\n   And your high tantrums. Just the way to spoil things! Be off. DAMIS\n   No, I must see--I'll keep my temper. DORINE\n   Out on you, what a plague! He's coming. Hide! (Damis goes and hides in the closet at the back of the stage.) SCENE II    TARTUFFE, DORINE\n \n \n   TARTUFFE (speaking to his valet, off the stage, as soon as he sees\n   Dorine is there)\n   Lawrence, put up my hair-cloth shirt and scourge,\n   And pray that Heaven may shed its light upon you.", "If any come to see me , say I 'm gone To share my alms among the prisoners . DORINE ( aside ) What affectation and what showing off ! TARTUFFE What do you want with me ? DORINE To tell you ... TARTUFFE ( taking a handkerchief from his pocket ) Ah ! Before you speak , pray take this handkerchief . DORINE What ? TARTUFFE Cover up that bosom , which I can't Endure to look on . Things like that offend Our souls , and fill our minds with sinful thoughts . DORINE Are you so tender to temptation , then , And has the flesh such power upon your senses ? I do n't know how you get in such a heat ; For my part , I am not so prone to lust , And I could see you stripped from head to foot , And all your hide not tempt me in the least . TARTUFFE Show in your speech some little modesty , Or I must instantly take leave of you . DORINE No , no , I 'll leave you to yourself ; I 've only One thing to say : Madam will soon be down , And begs the favour of a word with you . TARTUFFE Ah ! Willingly . DORINE ( aside ) How gentle all at once ! My faith , I still believe I 've hit upon it . TARTUFFE Will she come soon ? DORINE I think I hear her now . Yes , here she is herself ; I 'll leave you with her . SCENE III ELMIRE , TARTUFFE TARTUFFE May Heaven 's overflowing kindness ever Give you good health of body and of soul , And bless your days according to the wishes And prayers of its most humble votary ! ELMIRE I 'm very grateful for your pious wishes . But let 's sit down , so we may talk at ease . TARTUFFE ( after sitting down ) And how are you recovered from your illness ? ELMIRE ( sitting down also ) Quite well ; the fever soon let go its hold . TARTUFFE My prayers , I fear , have not sufficient merit To have drawn down this favour from on high ; But each entreaty that I made to Heaven Had for its object your recovery . ELMIRE You 're too solicitous on my behalf . TARTUFFE We could not cherish your dear health too much ; I would have given mine , to help restore it . ELMIRE That 's pushing Christian charity too far ; I owe you many thanks for so much kindness . TARTUFFE I do far less for you than you deserve . ELMIRE There is a matter that I wished to speak of In private ; I am glad there 's no one here To listen . TARTUFFE Madam , I am overjoyed . 'T is sweet to find myself alone with you . This is an opportunity I 've asked Of Heaven , many a time ; till now , in vain . ELMIRE All that I wish , is just a word from you , Quite frank and open , hiding nothing from me . ( DAMIS , without their seeing him , opens the closet door halfway . ) TARTUFFE I too could wish , as Heaven 's especial favour , To lay my soul quite open to your eyes , And swear to you , the trouble that I made About those visits which your charms attract , Does not result from any hatred toward you , But rather from a passionate devotion , And purest motives ... ELMIRE That is how I take it , I think 't is my salvation that concerns you . TARTUFFE ( pressing her finger tips ) Madam , 't is so ; and such is my devotion ... ELMIRE Ouch ! but you squeeze too hard . TARTUFFE Excess of zeal . In no way could I ever mean to hurt you , And I 'd as soon ... ( He puts his hand on her knee . ) ELMIRE What 's your hand doing there ? TARTUFFE Feeling your gown ; the stuff is very soft . ELMIRE Let be , I beg you ; I am very ticklish . ( She moves her chair away , and Tartuffe brings his nearer . ) TARTUFFE ( handling the lace yoke of Elmire 's dress ) Dear me how wonderful in workmanship This lace is ! They do marvels , nowadays ; Things of all kinds were never better made . ELMIRE Yes , very true . But let us come to business . They say my husband means to break his word . And marry Mariane to you . Is't so ? TARTUFFE He did hint some such thing ; but truly , madam , That 's not the happiness I 'm yearning after ; I see elsewhere the sweet compelling charms Of such a joy as fills my every wish . ELMIRE You mean you can not love terrestrial things . TARTUFFE The heart within my bosom is not stone . ELMIRE I well believe your sighs all tend to Heaven , And nothing here below can stay your thoughts . TARTUFFE Love for the beauty of eternal things Can not destroy our love for earthly beauty ; Our mortal senses well may be entranced By perfect works that Heaven has fashioned here . Its charms reflected shine in such as you , And in yourself , its rarest miracles ; It has displayed such marvels in your face , That eyes are dazed , and hearts are rapt away ; I could not look on you , the perfect creature , Without admiring Nature 's great Creator , And feeling all my heart inflamed with love For you , His fairest image of Himself . At first I trembled lest this secret love Might be the Evil Spirit 's artful snare ; I even schooled my heart to flee your beauty , Thinking it was a bar to my salvation . But soon , enlightened , O all lovely one , I saw how this my passion may be blameless , How I may make it fit with modesty , And thus completely yield my heart to it . 'T is I must own , a great presumption in me To dare make you the offer of my heart ; My love hopes all things from your perfect goodness , And nothing from my own poor weak endeavour . You are my hope , my stay , my peace of heart ; On you depends my torment or my bliss ; And by your doom of judgment , I shall be Blest , if you will ; or damned , by your decree . ELMIRE Your declaration 's turned most gallantly ; But truly , it is just a bit surprising . You should have better armed your heart , methinks , And taken thought somewhat on such a matter . A pious man like you , known everywhere ... TARTUFFE Though pious , I am none the less a man ; And when a man beholds your heavenly charms , The heart surrenders , and can think no more . I know such words seem strange , coming from me ; But , madam , I 'm no angel , after all ; If you condemn my frankly made avowal You only have your charming self to blame . Soon as I saw your more than human beauty , You were thenceforth the sovereign of my soul ; Sweetness ineffable was in your eyes , That took by storm my still resisting heart , And conquered everything , fasts , prayers , and tears , And turned my worship wholly to yourself . My looks , my sighs , have spoke a thousand times ; Now , to express it all , my voice must speak . If but you will look down with gracious favour Upon the sorrows of your worthless slave , If in your goodness you will give me comfort And condescend unto my nothingness , I 'll ever pay you , O sweet miracle , An unexampled worship and devotion . Then too , with me your honour runs no risk ; With me you need not fear a public scandal . These court gallants , that women are so fond of , Are boastful of their acts , and vain in speech ; They always brag in public of their progress ; Soon as a favour 's granted , they 'll divulge it ; Their tattling tongues , if you but trust to them , Will foul the altar where their hearts have worshipped . But men like me are so discreet in love , That you may trust their lasting secrecy . The care we take to guard our own good name May fully guarantee the one we love ; So you may find , with hearts like ours sincere , Love without scandal , pleasure without fear . ELMIRE I 've heard you through -- your speech is clear , at least . But do n't you fear that I may take a fancy To tell my husband of your gallant passion , And that a prompt report of this affair May somewhat change the friendship which he bears you ? TARTUFFE I know that you 're too good and generous , That you will pardon my temerity , Excuse , upon the score of human frailty , The violence of passion that offends you , And not forget , when you consult your mirror , That I 'm not blind , and man is made of flesh . ELMIRE Some women might do otherwise , perhaps , But I am willing to employ discretion , And not repeat the matter to my husband ; But in return , I 'll ask one thing of you : That you urge forward , frankly and sincerely , The marriage of Valere to Mariane ; That you give up the unjust influence By which you hope to win another 's rights ; And ... SCENE IV ELMIRE , DAMIS , TARTUFFE DAMIS ( coming out of the closet-room where he had been hiding ) No , I say ! This thing must be made public . I was just there , and overheard it all ; And Heaven 's goodness must have brought me there On purpose to confound this scoundrel 's pride And grant me means to take a signal vengeance On his hypocrisy and arrogance , And undeceive my father , showing up The rascal caught at making love to you . ELMIRE No , no ; it is enough if he reforms , Endeavouring to deserve the favour shown him . And since I 've promised , do not you belie me . 'T is not my way to make a public scandal ; An honest wife will scorn to heed such follies , And never fret her husband 's ears with them . DAMIS You 've reasons of your own for acting thus ; And I have mine for doing otherwise . To spare him now would be a mockery ; His bigot 's pride has triumphed all too long Over my righteous anger , and has caused Far too much trouble in our family . The rascal all too long has ruled my father , And crossed my sister 's love , and mine as well . The traitor now must be unmasked before him : And Providence has given me means to do it . To Heaven I owe the opportunity , And if I did not use it now I have it , I should deserve to lose it once for all . ELMIRE Damis ... DAMIS No , by your leave ; I 'll not be counselled . I 'm overjoyed . You need n't try to tell me I must give up the pleasure of revenge . I 'll make an end of this affair at once ; And , to content me , here 's my father now . SCENE V ORGON , ELMIRE , DAMIS , TARTUFFE DAMIS Father , we 've news to welcome your arrival , That 's altogether novel , and surprising . You are well paid for your caressing care , And this fine gentleman rewards your love Most handsomely , with zeal that seeks no less Than your dishonour , as has now been proven . I 've just surprised him making to your wife The shameful offer of a guilty love . She , somewhat over gentle and discreet , Insisted that the thing should be concealed ; But I will not condone such shamelessness , Nor so far wrong you as to keep it secret . ELMIRE Yes , I believe a wife should never trouble Her husband 's peace of mind with such vain gossip ; A woman 's honour does not hang on telling ; It is enough if she defend herself ; Or so I think ; Damis , you 'd not have spoken , If you would but have heeded my advice . SCENE VI ORGON , DAMIS , TARTUFFE ORGON Just Heaven ! Can what I hear be credited ? TARTUFFE Yes , brother , I am wicked , I am guilty , A miserable sinner , steeped in evil , The greatest criminal that ever lived . Each moment of my life is stained with soilures ; And all is but a mass of crime and filth ; Heaven , for my punishment , I see it plainly , Would mortify me now . Whatever wrong They find to charge me with , I 'll not deny it But guard against the pride of self-defence . Believe their stories , arm your wrath against me , And drive me like a villain from your house ; I can not have so great a share of shame But what I have deserved a greater still . ORGON ( to his son ) You miscreant , can you dare , with such a falsehood , To try to stain the whiteness of his virtue ? DAMIS What ! The feigned meekness of this hypocrite Makes you discredit ... ORGON Silence , cursed plague ! TARTUFFE Ah ! Let him speak ; you chide him wrongfully ; You 'd do far better to believe his tales . Why favour me so much in such a matter ? How can you know of what I 'm capable ? And should you trust my outward semblance , brother , Or judge therefrom that I 'm the better man ? No , no ; you let appearances deceive you ; I 'm anything but", "what I 'm thought to be , Alas ! and though all men believe me godly , The simple truth is , I 'm a worthless creature . ( To Damis ) Yes , my dear son , say on , and call me traitor , Abandoned scoundrel , thief , and murderer ; Heap on me names yet more detestable , And I shall not gainsay you ; I 've deserved them ; I 'll bear this ignominy on my knees , To expiate in shame the crimes I 've done . ORGON ( to Tartuffe ) Ah , brother , 't is too much ! ( To his son ) You 'll not relent , You blackguard ? DAMIS What ! His talk can so deceive you ... ORGON Silence , you scoundrel ! ( To Tartuffe ) Brother , rise , I beg you . ( To his son ) Infamous villain ! DAMIS Can he ... ORGON Silence ! DAMIS What ... ORGON Another word , I 'll break your every bone . TARTUFFE Brother , in God 's name , do n't be angry with him ! I 'd rather bear myself the bitterest torture Than have him get a scratch on my account . ORGON ( to his son ) Ungrateful monster ! TARTUFFE Stop . Upon my knees I beg you pardon him ... ORGON ( throwing himself on his knees too , and embracing Tartuffe ) Alas ! How can you ? ( To his son ) Villain ! Behold his goodness ! DAMIS So ... ORGON Be still . DAMIS What ! I ... ORGON Be still , I say . I know your motives For this attack . You hate him , all of you ; Wife , children , servants , all let loose upon him , You have recourse to every shameful trick To drive this godly man out of my house ; The more you strive to rid yourselves of him , The more I 'll strive to make him stay with me ; I 'll have him straightway married to my daughter , Just to confound the pride of all of you . DAMIS What ! Will you force her to accept his hand ? ORGON Yes , and this very evening , to enrage you , Young rascal ! Ah ! I 'll brave you all , and show you That I 'm the master , and must be obeyed . Now , down upon your knees this instant , rogue , And take back what you said , and ask his pardon . DAMIS Who ? I ? Ask pardon of that cheating scoundrel ... ? ORGON Do you resist , you beggar , and insult him ? A cudgel , here ! a cudgel ! ( To Tartuffe ) Do n't restrain me . ( To his son ) Off with you ! Leave my house this instant , sirrah , And never dare set foot in it again . DAMIS Yes , I will leave your house , but ... ORGON Leave it quickly . You reprobate , I disinherit you , And give you , too , my curse into the bargain . SCENE VII ORGON , TARTUFFE ORGON What ! So insult a saintly man of God ! TARTUFFE Heaven , forgive him all the pain he gives me ! [ 4 ] [ Footnote 4 : Some modern editions have adopted the reading , preserved by tradition as that of the earliest stage version : Heaven , forgive him even as I forgive him ! Voltaire gives still another reading : Heaven , forgive me even as I forgive him ! Whichever was the original version , it appears in none of the early editions , and Moliere probably felt forced to change it on account of its too close resemblance to the Biblical phrase . ] ( To Orgon ) Could you but know with what distress I see Them try to vilify me to my brother ! ORGON Ah ! TARTUFFE The mere thought of such ingratitude Makes my soul suffer torture , bitterly ... My horror at it ... Ah ! my heart 's so full I can not speak ... I think I 'll die of it . ORGON ( in tears , running to the door through which he drove away his son ) Scoundrel ! I wish I 'd never let you go , But slain you on the spot with my own hand . ( To Tartuffe ) Brother , compose yourself , and do n't be angry . TARTUFFE Nay , brother , let us end these painful quarrels . I see what troublous times I bring upon you , And think 't is needful that I leave this house . ORGON What ! You ca n't mean it ? TARTUFFE Yes , they hate me here , And try , I find , to make you doubt my faith . ORGON What of it ? Do you find I listen to them ? TARTUFFE No doubt they wo n't stop there . These same reports You now reject , may some day win a hearing . ORGON No , brother , never . TARTUFFE Ah ! my friend , a woman May easily mislead her husband 's mind . ORGON No , no . TARTUFFE So let me quickly go away And thus remove all cause for such attacks . ORGON No , you shall stay ; my life depends upon it . TARTUFFE Then I must mortify myself . And yet , If you should wish ... ORGON No , never ! TARTUFFE Very well , then ; No more of that . But I shall rule my conduct To fit the case . Honour is delicate , And friendship binds me to forestall suspicion , Prevent all scandal , and avoid your wife . ORGON No , you shall haunt her , just to spite them all . 'T is my delight to set them in a rage ; You shall be seen together at all hours And what is more , the better to defy them , I 'll have no other heir but you ; and straightway I 'll go and make a deed of gift to you , Drawn in due form , of all my property . A good true friend , my son-in-law to be , Is more to me than son , and wife , and kindred . You will accept my offer , will you not ? TARTUFFE Heaven 's will be done in everything ! ORGON Poor man ! We 'll go make haste to draw the deed aright , And then let envy burst itself with spite ! ACT IV SCENE I CLEANTE , TARTUFFE CLEANTE Yes , it 's become the talk of all the town , And make a stir that 's scarcely to your credit ; And I have met you , sir , most opportunely , To tell you in a word my frank opinion .", "Not to sift out this scandal to the bottom,\n   Suppose the worst for us--suppose Damis\n   Acted the traitor, and accused you falsely;\n   Should not a Christian pardon this offence,\n   And stifle in his heart all wish for vengeance? Should you permit that, for your petty quarrel,\n   A son be driven from his father's house? I tell you yet again, and tell you frankly,\n   Everyone, high or low, is scandalised;\n   If you'll take my advice, you'll make it up,\n   And not push matters to extremities. Make sacrifice to God of your resentment;\n   Restore the son to favour with his father. TARTUFFE\n   Alas! So far as I'm concerned, how gladly\n   Would I do so! I bear him no ill will;\n   I pardon all, lay nothing to his charge,\n   And wish with all my heart that I might serve him;\n   But Heaven's interests cannot allow it;\n   If he returns, then I must leave the house. After his conduct, quite unparalleled,\n   All intercourse between us would bring scandal;\n   God knows what everyone's first thought would be! They would attribute it to merest scheming\n   On my part--say that conscious of my guilt\n   I feigned a Christian love for my accuser,\n   But feared him in my heart, and hoped to win him\n   And underhandedly secure his silence. CLEANTE\n   You try to put us off with specious phrases;\n   But all your arguments are too far-fetched. Why take upon yourself the cause of Heaven? Does Heaven need our help to punish sinners? Leave to itself the care of its own vengeance,\n   And keep in mind the pardon it commands us;\n   Besides, think somewhat less of men's opinions,\n   When you are following the will of Heaven. Shall petty fear of what the world may think\n   Prevent the doing of a noble deed? No!--let us always do as Heaven commands,\n   And not perplex our brains with further questions. TARTUFFE\n   Already I have told you I forgive him;\n   And that is doing, sir, as Heaven commands. But after this day's scandal and affront\n   Heaven does not order me to live with him. CLEANTE\n   And does it order you to lend your ear\n   To what mere whim suggested to his father,\n   And to accept gift of his estates,\n   On which, in justice, you can make no claim? TARTUFFE\n   No one who knows me, sir, can have the thought\n   That I am acting from a selfish motive. The goods of this world have no charms for me;\n   I am not dazzled by their treacherous glamour;\n   And if I bring myself to take the gift\n   Which he insists on giving me, I do so,\n   To tell the truth, only because I fear\n   This whole estate may fall into bad hands,\n   And those to whom it comes may use it ill\n   And not employ it, as is my design,\n   For Heaven's glory and my neighbours' good. CLEANTE\n   Eh, sir, give up these conscientious scruples\n   That well may cause a rightful heir's complaints. Don't take so much upon yourself, but let him\n   Possess what's his, at his own risk and peril;\n   Consider, it were better he misused it,\n   Than you should be accused of robbing him. I am astounded that unblushingly\n   You could allow such offers to be made! Tell me--has true religion any maxim\n   That teaches us to rob the lawful heir? If Heaven has made it quite impossible\n   Damis and you should live together here,\n   Were it not better you should quietly\n   And honourably withdraw, than let the son\n   Be driven out for your sake, dead against\n   All reason? 'Twould be giving, sir, believe me,\n   Such an example of your probity ...\n \n   TARTUFFE\n   Sir, it is half-past three; certain devotions\n   Recall me to my closet; you'll forgive me\n   For leaving you so soon. CLEANTE (alone)\n   Ah! SCENE II\n \n   ELMIRE, MARIANE, CLEANTE, DORINE\n \n \n   DORINE (to Cleante)\n   Sir, we beg you\n   To help us all you can in her behalf;\n   She's suffering almost more than heart can bear;\n   This match her father means to make to-night\n   Drives her each moment to despair. He's coming. Let us unite our efforts now, we beg you,\n   And try by strength or skill to change his purpose. SCENE III\n \n   ORGON, ELMIRE, MARIANE, CLEANTE, DORINE\n \n \n   ORGON\n   So ho! I'm glad to find you all together. (To Mariane)\n   Here is the contract that shall make you happy,\n   My dear. You know already what it means. MARIANE (on her knees before Orgon)\n   Father, I beg you, in the name of Heaven\n   That knows my grief, and by whate'er can move you,\n   Relax a little your paternal rights,\n   And free my love from this obedience! Oh, do not make me, by your harsh command,\n   Complain to Heaven you ever were my father;\n   Do not make wretched this poor life you gave me. If, crossing that fond hope which I had formed,\n   You'll not permit me to belong to one\n   Whom I have dared to love, at least, I beg you\n   Upon my knees, oh, save me from the torment\n   Of being possessed by one whom I abhor! And do not drive me to some desperate act\n   By exercising all your rights upon me. ORGON (a little touched)\n   Come, come, my heart, be firm! no human weakness! MARIANE\n   I am not jealous of your love for him;\n   Display it freely; give him your estate,\n   And if that's not enough, add all of mine;\n   I willingly agree, and give it up,\n   If only you'll not give him me, your daughter;\n   Oh, rather let a convent's rigid rule\n   Wear out the wretched days that Heaven allots me. ORGON\n   These girls are ninnies!--always turning nuns\n   When fathers thwart their silly love-affairs. Get on your feet! The more you hate to have him,\n   The more 'twill help you earn your soul's salvation. So, mortify your senses by this marriage,\n   And don't vex me about it any more. DORINE\n   But what ... ? ORGON\n   You hold your tongue, before your betters. Don't dare to say a single word, I tell you. CLEANTE\n   If you will let me answer, and advise ...\n \n   ORGON\n   Brother, I value your advice most highly;\n   'Tis well thought out; no better can be had;\n   But you'll allow me--not to follow it. ELMIRE (to her husband)\n   I can't find words to cope with such a case;\n   Your blindness makes me quite astounded at you. You are bewitched with him, to disbelieve\n   The things we tell you happened here to-day. ORGON\n   I am your humble servant, and can see\n   Things, when they're plain as noses on folks' faces,\n   I know you're partial to my rascal son,\n   And didn't dare to disavow the trick\n   He tried to play on this poor man; besides,\n   You were too calm, to be believed; if that\n   Had happened, you'd have been far more disturbed. ELMIRE\n   And must our honour always rush to arms\n   At the mere mention of illicit love? Or can we answer no attack upon it\n   Except with blazing eyes and lips of scorn? For my part, I just laugh away such nonsense;\n   I've no desire to make a loud to-do. Our virtue should, I think, be gentle-natured;\n   Nor can I quite approve those savage prudes\n   Whose honour arms itself with teeth and claws\n   To tear men's eyes out at the slightest word. Heaven preserve me from that kind of honour! I like my virtue not to be a vixen,\n   And I believe a quiet cold rebuff\n   No less effective to repulse a lover. ORGON\n   I know ... and you can't throw me off the scent. ELMIRE\n   Once more, I am astounded at your weakness;\n   I wonder what your unbelief would answer,\n   If I should let you see we've told the truth? ORGON\n   See it? ELMIRE\n   Yes. ORGON\n   Nonsense. ELMIRE\n   Come! If I should find\n   A way to make you see it clear as day? ORGON\n   All rubbish. ELMIRE\n   What a man! But answer me. I'm not proposing now that you believe us;\n   But let's suppose that here, from proper hiding,\n   You should be made to see and hear all plainly;\n   What would you say then, to your man of virtue? ORGON\n   Why, then, I'd say ... say nothing. It can't be. ELMIRE\n   Your error has endured too long already,\n   And quite too long you've branded me a liar. I must at once, for my own satisfaction,\n   Make you a witness of the things we've told you. ORGON\n   Amen! I take you at your word. We'll see\n   What tricks you have, and how you'll keep your promise. ELMIRE (to Dorine)\n   Send him to me. DORINE (to Elmire)\n   The man's a crafty codger,\n   Perhaps you'll find it difficult to catch him. ELMIRE (to Dorine)\n   Oh no! A lover's never hard to cheat,\n   And self-conceit leads straight to self-deceit. Bid him come down to me. (To Cleante and Mariane)\n   And you, withdraw. SCENE IV\n \n   ELMIRE, ORGON\n \n \n   ELMIRE\n   Bring up this table, and get under it. ORGON\n   What? ELMIRE\n   One essential is to hide you well. ORGON\n   Why under there? ELMIRE\n   Oh, dear! Do as I say;\n   I know what I'm about, as you shall see. Get under, now, I tell you; and once there\n   Be careful no one either sees or hears you. ORGON\n   I'm going a long way to humour you,\n   I must say; but I'll see you through your scheme. ELMIRE\n   And then you'll have, I think, no more to say. (To her husband, who is now under the table.) But mind, I'm going to meddle with strange matters;\n   Prepare yourself to be in no wise shocked. Whatever I may say must pass, because\n   'Tis only to convince you, as I promised. By wheedling speeches, since I'm forced to do it,\n   I'll make this hypocrite put off his mask,\n   Flatter the longings of his shameless passion,\n   And give free play to all his impudence. But, since 'tis for your sake, to prove to you\n   His guilt, that I shall feign to share his love,\n   I can leave off as soon as you're convinced,\n   And things shall go no farther than you choose. So, when you think they've gone quite far enough,\n   It is for you to stop his mad pursuit,\n   To spare your wife, and not expose me farther\n   Than you shall need, yourself, to undeceive you. It is your own affair, and you must end it\n   When ... Here he comes. Keep still, don't show yourself. SCENE V\n \n   TARTUFFE, ELMIRE; ORGON (under the table)\n \n \n   TARTUFFE\n   They told me that you wished to see me here.", "ELMIRE\n   Yes. I have secrets for your ear alone. But shut the door first, and look everywhere\n   For fear of spies. (Tartuffe goes and closes the door, and comes back.) We surely can't afford\n   Another scene like that we had just now;\n   Was ever anyone so caught before! Damis did frighten me most terribly\n   On your account; you saw I did my best\n   To baffle his design, and calm his anger. But I was so confused, I never thought\n   To contradict his story; still, thank Heaven,\n   Things turned out all the better, as it happened,\n   And now we're on an even safer footing. The high esteem you're held in, laid the storm;\n   My husband can have no suspicion of you,\n   And even insists, to spite the scandal-mongers,\n   That we shall be together constantly;\n   So that is how, without the risk of blame,\n   I can be here locked up with you alone,\n   And can reveal to you my heart, perhaps\n   Only too ready to allow your passion. TARTUFFE\n   Your words are somewhat hard to understand,\n   Madam; just now you used a different style. ELMIRE\n   If that refusal has offended you,\n   How little do you know a woman's heart! How ill you guess what it would have you know,\n   When it presents so feeble a defence! Always, at first, our modesty resists\n   The tender feelings you inspire us with. Whatever cause we find to justify\n   The love that masters us, we still must feel\n   Some little shame in owning it; and strive\n   To make as though we would not, when we would. But from the very way we go about it\n   We let a lover know our heart surrenders,\n   The while our lips, for honour's sake, oppose\n   Our heart's desire, and in refusing promise. I'm telling you my secret all too freely\n   And with too little heed to modesty. But--now that I've made bold to speak--pray tell me. Should I have tried to keep Damis from speaking,\n   Should I have heard the offer of your heart\n   So quietly, and suffered all your pleading,\n   And taken it just as I did--remember--\n   If such a declaration had not pleased me,\n   And, when I tried my utmost to persuade you\n   Not to accept the marriage that was talked of,\n   What should my earnestness have hinted to you\n   If not the interest that you've inspired,\n   And my chagrin, should such a match compel me\n   To share a heart I want all to myself? TARTUFFE\n   'Tis, past a doubt, the height of happiness,\n   To hear such words from lips we dote upon;\n   Their honeyed sweetness pours through all my senses\n   Long draughts of suavity ineffable. My heart employs its utmost zeal to please you,\n   And counts your love its one beatitude;\n   And yet that heart must beg that you allow it\n   To doubt a little its felicity. I well might think these words an honest trick\n   To make me break off this approaching marriage;\n   And if I may express myself quite plainly,\n   I cannot trust these too enchanting words\n   Until the granting of some little favour\n   I sigh for, shall assure me of their truth\n   And build within my soul, on firm foundations,\n   A lasting faith in your sweet charity. ELMIRE (coughing to draw her husband's attention)\n   What! Must you go so fast?--and all at once\n   Exhaust the whole love of a woman's heart? She does herself the violence to make\n   This dear confession of her love, and you\n   Are not yet satisfied, and will not be\n   Without the granting of her utmost favours? TARTUFFE\n   The less a blessing is deserved, the less\n   We dare to hope for it; and words alone\n   Can ill assuage our love's desires. A fate\n   Too full of happiness, seems doubtful still;\n   We must enjoy it ere we can believe it. And I, who know how little I deserve\n   Your goodness, doubt the fortunes of my daring;\n   So I shall trust to nothing, madam, till\n   You have convinced my love by something real. ELMIRE\n   Ah! How your love enacts the tyrant's role,\n   And throws my mind into a strange confusion! With what fierce sway it rules a conquered heart,\n   And violently will have its wishes granted! What! Is there no escape from your pursuit? No respite even?--not a breathing space? Nay, is it decent to be so exacting,\n   And so abuse by urgency the weakness\n   You may discover in a woman's heart? TARTUFFE\n   But if my worship wins your gracious favour,\n   Then why refuse me some sure proof thereof? ELMIRE\n   But how can I consent to what you wish,\n   Without offending Heaven you talk so much of? TARTUFFE\n   If Heaven is all that stands now in my way,\n   I'll easily remove that little hindrance;\n   Your heart need not hold back for such a trifle. ELMIRE\n   But they affright us so with Heaven's commands! TARTUFFE\n   I can dispel these foolish fears, dear madam;\n   I know the art of pacifying scruples\n   Heaven forbids, 'tis true, some satisfactions;\n   But we find means to make things right with Heaven. ('Tis a scoundrel speaking.) [5]\n \n   [Footnote 5: Moliere's note, in the original edition.] There is a science, madam, that instructs us\n   How to enlarge the limits of our conscience\n   According to our various occasions,\n   And rectify the evil of the deed\n   According to our purity of motive. I'll duly teach you all these secrets, madam;\n   You only need to let yourself be guided. Content my wishes, have no fear at all;\n   I answer for't, and take the sin upon me. (Elmire coughs still louder.) Your cough is very bad. ELMIRE\n   Yes, I'm in torture. TARTUFFE\n   Would you accept this bit of licorice? ELMIRE\n   The case is obstinate, I find; and all\n   The licorice in the world will do no good. TARTUFFE\n   'Tis very trying. ELMIRE\n   More than words can say. TARTUFFE\n   In any case, your scruple's easily\n   Removed. With me you're sure of secrecy,\n   And there's no harm unless a thing is known. The public scandal is what brings offence,\n   And secret sinning is not sin at all. ELMIRE (after coughing again)\n   So then, I see I must resolve to yield;\n   I must consent to grant you everything,\n   And cannot hope to give full satisfaction\n   Or win full confidence, at lesser cost. No doubt 'tis very hard to come to this;\n   'Tis quite against my will I go so far;\n   But since I must be forced to it, since nothing\n   That can be said suffices for belief,\n   Since more convincing proof is still demanded,\n   I must make up my mind to humour people. If my consent give reason for offence,\n   So much the worse for him who forced me to it;\n   The fault can surely not be counted mine. TARTUFFE\n   It need not, madam; and the thing itself ...\n \n   ELMIRE\n   Open the door, I pray you, and just see\n   Whether my husband's not there, in the hall. TARTUFFE\n   Why take such care for him? Between ourselves,\n   He is a man to lead round by the nose. He's capable of glorying in our meetings;\n   I've fooled him so, he'd see all, and deny it. ELMIRE\n   No matter; go, I beg you, look about,\n   And carefully examine every corner. SCENE VI\n \n   ORGON, ELMIRE\n \n \n   ORGON (crawling out from under the table)\n   That is, I own, a man ... abominable! I can't get over it; the whole thing floors me. ELMIRE\n   What? You come out so soon? You cannot mean it! Get back under the table; 'tis not time yet;\n   Wait till the end, to see, and make quite certain,\n   And don't believe a thing on mere conjecture. ORGON\n   Nothing more wicked e'er came out of Hell. ELMIRE\n   Dear me! Don't go and credit things too lightly. No, let yourself be thoroughly convinced;\n   Don't yield too soon, for fear you'll be mistaken. (As Tartuffe enters, she makes her husband stand behind her.) SCENE VII\n \n   TARTUFFE, ELMIRE, ORGON\n \n \n   TARTUFFE (not seeing Orgon)\n   All things conspire toward my satisfaction,\n   Madam, I've searched the whole apartment through. There's no one here; and now my ravished soul ...\n \n   ORGON (stopping him)\n   Softly! You are too eager in your amours;\n   You needn't be so passionate. Ah ha! My holy man! You want to put it on me! How is your soul abandoned to temptation! Marry my daughter, eh?--and want my wife, too? I doubted long enough if this was earnest,\n   Expecting all the time the tone would change;\n   But now the proof's been carried far enough;\n   I'm satisfied, and ask no more, for my part. ELMIRE (to Tartuffe)\n   'Twas quite against my character to play\n   This part; but I was forced to treat you so. TARTUFFE\n   What? You believe ... ? ORGON\n   Come, now, no protestations. Get out from here, and make no fuss about it. TARTUFFE\n   But my intent ...\n \n   ORGON\n   That talk is out of season. You leave my house this instant. TARTUFFE\n   You're the one\n   To leave it, you who play the master here! This house belongs to me, I'll have you know,\n   And show you plainly it's no use to turn\n   To these low tricks, to pick a quarrel with me,\n   And that you can't insult me at your pleasure,\n   For I have wherewith to confound your lies,\n   Avenge offended Heaven, and compel\n   Those to repent who talk to me of leaving. SCENE VIII\n \n   ELMIRE, ORGON\n \n \n   ELMIRE\n   What sort of speech is this? What can it mean? ORGON\n   My faith, I'm dazed. This is no laughing matter. ELMIRE\n   What? ORGON\n   From his words I see my great mistake;\n   The deed of gift is one thing troubles me. ELMIRE\n   The deed of gift ...\n \n   ORGON\n   Yes, that is past recall. But I've another thing to make me anxious. ELMIRE\n   What's that? ORGON\n   You shall know all. Let's see at once\n   Whether a certain box is still upstairs. ACT V   SCENE I\n \n   ORGON, CLEANTE\n \n \n   CLEANTE\n   Whither away so fast?", "ORGON\n   How should I know? CLEANTE\n   Methinks we should begin by taking counsel\n   To see what can be done to meet the case. ORGON\n   I'm all worked up about that wretched box. More than all else it drives me to despair. CLEANTE\n   That box must hide some mighty mystery? ORGON\n   Argas, my friend who is in trouble, brought it\n   Himself, most secretly, and left it with me. He chose me, in his exile, for this trust;\n   And on these documents, from what he said,\n   I judge his life and property depend. CLEANTE\n   How could you trust them to another's hands? ORGON\n   By reason of a conscientious scruple. I went straight to my traitor, to confide\n   In him; his sophistry made me believe\n   That I must give the box to him to keep,\n   So that, in case of search, I might deny\n   My having it at all, and still, by favour\n   Of this evasion, keep my conscience clear\n   Even in taking oath against the truth. CLEANTE\n   Your case is bad, so far as I can see;\n   This deed of gift, this trusting of the secret\n   To him, were both--to state my frank opinion--\n   Steps that you took too lightly; he can lead you\n   To any length, with these for hostages;\n   And since he holds you at such disadvantage,\n   You'd be still more imprudent, to provoke him;\n   So you must go some gentler way about. ORGON\n   What! Can a soul so base, a heart so false,\n   Hide neath the semblance of such touching fervour? I took him in, a vagabond, a beggar! ...\n   'Tis too much! No more pious folk for me! I shall abhor them utterly forever,\n   And henceforth treat them worse than any devil. CLEANTE\n   So! There you go again, quite off the handle! In nothing do you keep an even temper. You never know what reason is, but always\n   Jump first to one extreme, and then the other. You see your error, and you recognise\n   That you've been cozened by a feigned zeal;\n   But to make up for't, in the name of reason,\n   Why should you plunge into a worse mistake,\n   And find no difference in character\n   Between a worthless scamp, and all good people? What! Just because a rascal boldly duped you\n   With pompous show of false austerity,\n   Must you needs have it everybody's like him,\n   And no one's truly pious nowadays? Leave such conclusions to mere infidels;\n   Distinguish virtue from its counterfeit,\n   Don't give esteem too quickly, at a venture,\n   But try to keep, in this, the golden mean. If you can help it, don't uphold imposture;\n   But do not rail at true devoutness, either;\n   And if you must fall into one extreme,\n   Then rather err again the other way. SCENE II\n \n   DAMIS, ORGON, CLEANTE\n \n \n   DAMIS\n   What!", "father, can the scoundrel threaten you,\n   Forget the many benefits received,\n   And in his base abominable pride\n   Make of your very favours arms against you? ORGON\n   Too true, my son. It tortures me to think on't. DAMIS\n   Let me alone, I'll chop his ears off for him. We must deal roundly with his insolence;\n   'Tis I must free you from him at a blow;\n   'Tis I, to set things right, must strike him down. CLEANTE\n   Spoke like a true young man. Now just calm down,\n   And moderate your towering tantrums, will you? We live in such an age, with such a king,\n   That violence can not advance our cause. SCENE III\n \n   MADAME PERNELLE, ORGON, ELMIRE, CLEANTE, MARIANE, DAMIS, DORINE\n \n \n   MADAME PERNELLE\n   What's this? I hear of fearful mysteries! ORGON\n   Strange things indeed, for my own eyes to witness;\n   You see how I'm requited for my kindness,\n   I zealously receive a wretched beggar,\n   I lodge him, entertain him like my brother,\n   Load him with benefactions every day,\n   Give him my daughter, give him all my fortune:\n   And he meanwhile, the villain, rascal, wretch,\n   Tries with black treason to suborn my wife,\n   And not content with such a foul design,\n   He dares to menace me with my own favours,\n   And would make use of those advantages\n   Which my too foolish kindness armed him with,\n   To ruin me, to take my fortune from me,\n   And leave me in the state I saved him from. DORINE\n   Poor man! MADAME PERNELLE\n   My son, I cannot possibly\n   Believe he could intend so black a deed. ORGON\n   What? MADAME PERNELLE\n   Worthy men are still the sport of envy. ORGON\n   Mother, what do you mean by such a speech? MADAME PERNELLE\n   There are strange goings-on about your house,\n   And everybody knows your people hate him. ORGON\n   What's that to do with what I tell you now? MADAME PERNELLE\n   I always said, my son, when you were little:\n   That virtue here below is hated ever;\n   The envious may die, but envy never. ORGON\n   What's that fine speech to do with present facts? MADAME PERNELLE\n   Be sure, they've forged a hundred silly lies ...\n \n   ORGON\n   I've told you once, I saw it all myself. MADAME PERNELLE\n   For slanderers abound in calumnies ...\n \n   ORGON\n   Mother, you'd make me damn my soul. I tell you\n   I saw with my own eyes his shamelessness. MADAME PERNELLE\n   Their tongues for spitting venom never lack,\n   There's nothing here below they'll not attack. ORGON\n   Your speech has not a single grain of sense. I saw it, harkee, saw it, with these eyes\n   I saw--d'ye know what saw means?--must I say it\n   A hundred times, and din it in your ears? MADAME PERNELLE\n   My dear, appearances are oft deceiving,\n   And seeing shouldn't always be believing. ORGON\n   I'll go mad. MADAME PERNELLE\n   False suspicions may delude,\n   And good to evil oft is misconstrued. ORGON\n   Must I construe as Christian charity\n   The wish to kiss my wife! MADAME PERNELLE\n   You must, at least,\n   Have just foundation for accusing people,\n   And wait until you see a thing for sure. ORGON\n   The devil! How could I see any surer? Should I have waited till, before my eyes,\n   He ... No, you'll make me say things quite improper. MADAME PERNELLE\n   In short, 'tis known too pure a zeal inflames him;\n   And so, I cannot possibly conceive\n   That he should try to do what's charged against him. ORGON\n   If you were not my mother, I should say\n   Such things! ... I know not what, I'm so enraged! DORINE (to Orgon)\n   Fortune has paid you fair, to be so doubted;\n   You flouted our report, now yours is flouted. CLEANTE\n   We're wasting time here in the merest trifling,\n   Which we should rather use in taking measures\n   To guard ourselves against the scoundrel's threats. DAMIS\n   You think his impudence could go far? ELMIRE\n   For one, I can't believe it possible;\n   Why, his ingratitude would be too patent. CLEANTE\n   Don't trust to that; he'll find abundant warrant\n   To give good colour to his acts against you;\n   And for less cause than this, a strong cabal\n   Can make one's life a labyrinth of troubles. I tell you once again: armed as he is\n   You never should have pushed him quite so far. ORGON\n   True; yet what could I do? The rascal's pride\n   Made me lose all control of my resentment. CLEANTE\n   I wish with all my heart that some pretence\n   Of peace could be patched up between you two\n \n   ELMIRE\n   If I had known what weapons he was armed with,\n   I never should have raised such an alarm,\n   And my ...\n \n   ORGON (to Dorine, seeing Mr. Loyal come in)\n   Who's coming now? Go quick, find out. I'm in a fine state to receive a visit! SCENE IV\n \n   ORGON, MADAME PERNELLE, ELMIRE, MARIANE, CLEANTE, DAMIS, DORINE,\n   MR.", "LOYAL\n \n \n   MR. LOYAL (to Dorine, at the back of the stage)\n   Good day, good sister. Pray you, let me see\n   The master of the house. DORINE\n   He's occupied;\n   I think he can see nobody at present. MR. LOYAL\n   I'm not by way of being unwelcome here. My coming can, I think, nowise displease him;\n   My errand will be found to his advantage. DORINE\n   Your name, then? MR. LOYAL\n   Tell him simply that his friend\n   Mr. Tartuffe has sent me, for his goods ...\n \n   DORINE (to Orgon)\n   It is a man who comes, with civil manners,\n   Sent by Tartuffe, he says, upon an errand\n   That you'll be pleased with. CLEANTE (to Orgon)\n   Surely you must see him,\n   And find out who he is, and what he wants. ORGON (to Cleante)\n   Perhaps he's come to make it up between us:\n   How shall I treat him? CLEANTE\n   You must not get angry;\n   And if he talks of reconciliation\n   Accept it. MR. LOYAL (to Orgon)\n   Sir, good-day. And Heaven send\n   Harm to your enemies, favour to you. ORGON (aside to Cleante)\n   This mild beginning suits with my conjectures\n   And promises some compromise already. MR. LOYAL\n   All of your house has long been dear to me;\n   I had the honour, sir, to serve your father. ORGON\n   Sir, I am much ashamed, and ask your pardon\n   For not recalling now your face or name. MR. LOYAL\n   My name is Loyal. I'm from Normandy. My office is court-bailiff, in despite\n   Of envy; and for forty years, thank Heaven,\n   It's been my fortune to perform that office\n   With honour. So I've come, sir, by your leave\n   To render service of a certain writ ...\n \n   ORGON\n   What, you are here to ...\n \n   MR. LOYAL\n   Pray, sir, don't be angry. 'Tis nothing, sir, but just a little summons:--\n   Order to vacate, you and yours, this house,\n   Move out your furniture, make room for others,\n   And that without delay or putting off,\n   As needs must be ...\n \n   ORGON\n   I? Leave this house? MR. LOYAL\n   Yes, please, sir\n   The house is now, as you well know, of course,\n   Mr. Tartuffe's. And he, beyond dispute,\n   Of all your goods is henceforth lord and master\n   By virtue of a contract here attached,\n   Drawn in due form, and unassailable. DAMIS (to Mr. Loyal)\n   Your insolence is monstrous, and astounding! MR. LOYAL (to Damis)\n   I have no business, sir, that touches you;\n \n   (Pointing to Orgon)\n   This is the gentleman. He's fair and courteous,\n   And knows too well a gentleman's behaviour\n   To wish in any wise to question justice. ORGON\n   But ...\n \n   MR. LOYAL\n   Sir, I know you would not for a million\n   Wish to rebel; like a good citizen\n   You'll let me put in force the court's decree. DAMIS\n   Your long black gown may well, before you know it,\n   Mister Court-bailiff, get a thorough beating. MR. LOYAL (to Orgon)\n   Sir, make your son be silent or withdraw. I should be loath to have to set things down,\n   And see your names inscribed in my report. DORINE (aside)\n   This Mr. Loyal's looks are most disloyal. MR. LOYAL\n   I have much feeling for respectable\n   And honest folk like you, sir, and consented\n   To serve these papers, only to oblige you,\n   And thus prevent the choice of any other\n   Who, less possessed of zeal for you than I am\n   Might order matters in less gentle fashion. ORGON\n   And how could one do worse than order people\n   Out of their house? MR. LOYAL\n   Why, we allow you time;\n   And even will suspend until to-morrow\n   The execution of the order, sir. I'll merely, without scandal, quietly,\n   Come here and spend the night, with half a score\n   Of officers; and just for form's sake, please,\n   You'll bring your keys to me, before retiring. I will take care not to disturb your rest,\n   And see there's no unseemly conduct here. But by to-morrow, and at early morning,\n   You must make haste to move your least belongings;\n   My men will help you--I have chosen strong ones\n   To serve you, sir, in clearing out the house. No one could act more generously, I fancy,\n   And, since I'm treating you with great indulgence,\n   I beg you'll do as well by me, and see\n   I'm not disturbed in my discharge of duty. ORGON\n   I'd give this very minute, and not grudge it,\n   The hundred best gold louis I have left,\n   If I could just indulge myself, and land\n   My fist, for one good square one, on his snout. CLEANTE (aside to Orgon)\n   Careful!--don't make things worse. DAMIS\n   Such insolence! I hardly can restrain myself. My hands\n   Are itching to be at him. DORINE\n   By my faith,\n   With such a fine broad back, good Mr. Loyal,\n   A little beating would become you well. MR. LOYAL\n   My girl, such infamous words are actionable. And warrants can be issued against women. CLEANTE (to Mr. Loyal)\n   Enough of this discussion, sir; have done. Give us the paper, and then leave us, pray. MR. LOYAL\n   Then _au revoir_. Heaven keep you from disaster! ORGON\n   May Heaven confound you both, you and your master! SCENE V\n \n   ORGON, MADAME PERNELLE, ELMIRE, CLEANTE, MARIANE, DAMIS, DORINE\n \n \n   ORGON\n   Well, mother, am I right or am I not?", "This writ may help you now to judge the matter. Or don't you see his treason even yet? MADAME PERNELLE\n   I'm all amazed, befuddled, and beflustered! DORINE (to Orgon)\n   You are quite wrong, you have no right to blame him;\n   This action only proves his good intentions. Love for his neighbour makes his virtue perfect;\n   And knowing money is a root of evil,\n   In Christian charity, he'd take away\n   Whatever things may hinder your salvation. ORGON\n   Be still. You always need to have that told you. CLEANTE (to Orgon)\n   Come, let us see what course you are to follow. ELMIRE\n   Go and expose his bold ingratitude. Such action must invalidate the contract;\n   His perfidy must now appear too black\n   To bring him the success that he expects. SCENE VI\n \n   VALERE, ORGON, MADAME PERNELLE, ELMIRE, CLEANTE, MARIANE, DAMIS,\n   DORINE\n \n \n   VALERE\n   'Tis with regret, sir, that I bring bad news;\n   But urgent danger forces me to do so.", "A close and intimate friend of mine, who knows\n   The interest I take in what concerns you,\n   Has gone so far, for my sake, as to break\n   The secrecy that's due to state affairs,\n   And sent me word but now, that leaves you only\n   The one expedient of sudden flight. The villain who so long imposed upon you,\n   Found means, an hour ago, to see the prince,\n   And to accuse you (among other things)\n   By putting in his hands the private strong-box\n   Of a state-criminal, whose guilty secret,\n   You, failing in your duty as a subject,\n   (He says) have kept. I know no more of it\n   Save that a warrant's drawn against you, sir,\n   And for the greater surety, that same rascal\n   Comes with the officer who must arrest you. CLEANTE\n   His rights are armed; and this is how the scoundrel\n   Seeks to secure the property he claims. ORGON\n   Man is a wicked animal, I'll own it! VALERE\n   The least delay may still be fatal, sir. I have my carriage, and a thousand louis,\n   Provided for your journey, at the door. Let's lose no time; the bolt is swift to strike,\n   And such as only flight can save you from. I'll be your guide to seek a place of safety,\n   And stay with you until you reach it, sir. ORGON\n   How much I owe to your obliging care! Another time must serve to thank you fitly;\n   And I pray Heaven to grant me so much favour\n   That I may some day recompense your service. Good-bye; see to it, all of you ...\n \n   CLEANTE\n   Come hurry;\n   We'll see to everything that's needful, brother. SCENE VII\n \n   TARTUFFE, AN OFFICER, MADAME PERNELLE, ORGON, ELMIRE, CLEANTE,\n   MARIANE, VALERE, DAMIS, DORINE\n \n \n   TARTUFFE (stopping Orgon)\n   Softly, sir, softly; do not run so fast;\n   You haven't far to go to find your lodging;\n   By order of the prince, we here arrest you.", "ORGON\n   Traitor! You saved this worst stroke for the last;\n   This crowns your perfidies, and ruins me. TARTUFFE\n   I shall not be embittered by your insults,\n   For Heaven has taught me to endure all things. CLEANTE\n   Your moderation, I must own, is great. DAMIS\n   How shamelessly the wretch makes bold with Heaven! TARTUFFE\n   Your ravings cannot move me; all my thought\n   Is but to do my duty. MARIANE\n   You must claim\n   Great glory from this honourable act. TARTUFFE\n   The act cannot be aught but honourable,\n   Coming from that high power which sends me here. ORGON\n   Ungrateful wretch, do you forget 'twas I\n   That rescued you from utter misery? TARTUFFE\n   I've not forgot some help you may have given;\n   But my first duty now is toward my prince. The higher power of that most sacred claim\n   Must stifle in my heart all gratitude;\n   And to such puissant ties I'd sacrifice\n   My friend, my wife, my kindred, and myself. ELMIRE\n   The hypocrite! DORINE\n   How well he knows the trick\n   Of cloaking him with what we most revere! CLEANTE\n   But if the motive that you make parade of\n   Is perfect as you say, why should it wait\n   To show itself, until the day he caught you\n   Soliciting his wife? How happens it\n   You have not thought to go inform against him\n   Until his honour forces him to drive you\n   Out of his house? And though I need not mention\n   That he'd just given you his whole estate,\n   Still, if you meant to treat him now as guilty,\n   How could you then consent to take his gift? TARTUFFE (to the Officer)\n   Pray, sir, deliver me from all this clamour;\n   Be good enough to carry out your order. THE OFFICER\n   Yes, I've too long delayed its execution;\n   'Tis very fitting you should urge me to it;\n   So therefore, you must follow me at once\n   To prison, where you'll find your lodging ready. TARTUFFE\n   Who? I, sir? THE OFFICER\n   You. TARTUFFE\n   By why to prison? THE OFFICER\n   You\n   Are not the one to whom I owe account. You, sir (to Orgon), recover from your hot alarm. Our prince is not a friend to double dealing,\n   His eyes can read men's inmost hearts, and all\n   The art of hypocrites cannot deceive him. His sharp discernment sees things clear and true;\n   His mind cannot too easily be swayed,\n   For reason always holds the balance even. He honours and exalts true piety,\n   But knows the false, and views it with disgust. This fellow was by no means apt to fool him,\n   Far subtler snares have failed against his wisdom,\n   And his quick insight pierced immediately\n   The hidden baseness of this tortuous heart. Accusing you, the knave betrayed himself,\n   And by true recompense of Heaven's justice\n   He stood revealed before our monarch's eyes\n   A scoundrel known before by other names,\n   Whose horrid crimes, detailed at length, might fill\n   A long-drawn history of many volumes. Our monarch--to resolve you in a word--\n   Detesting his ingratitude and baseness,\n   Added this horror to his other crimes,\n   And sent me hither under his direction\n   To see his insolence out-top itself,\n   And force him then to give you satisfaction. Your papers, which the traitor says are his,\n   I am to take from him, and give you back;\n   The deed of gift transferring your estate\n   Our monarch's sovereign will makes null and void;\n   And for the secret personal offence\n   Your friend involved you in, he pardons you:\n   Thus he rewards your recent zeal, displayed\n   In helping to maintain his rights, and shows\n   How well his heart, when it is least expected,\n   Knows how to recompense a noble deed,\n   And will not let true merit miss its due,\n   Remembering always rather good than evil. DORINE\n   Now Heaven be praised! MADAME PERNELLE\n   At last I breathe again. ELMIRE\n   A happy outcome! MARIANE\n   Who'd have dared to hope it? ORGON (to Tartuffe, who is being led by the officer)\n   There traitor! Now you're ... SCENE VIII\n \n   MADAME PERNELLE, ORGON, ELMIRE, MARIANE, CLEANTE, VALERE, DAMIS,\n   DORINE\n \n \n   CLEANTE\n   Brother, hold!--and don't\n   Descend to such indignities, I beg you. Leave the poor wretch to his unhappy fate,\n   And let remorse oppress him, but not you. Hope rather that his heart may now return\n   To virtue, hate his vice, reform his ways,\n   And win the pardon of our glorious prince;\n   While you must straightway go, and on your knees\n   Repay with thanks his noble generous kindness. ORGON\n   Well said! We'll go, and at his feet kneel down,\n   With joy to thank him for his goodness shown;\n   And this first duty done, with honours due,\n   We'll then attend upon another, too. With wedded happiness reward Valere,\n   And crown a lover noble and sincere."], "summaries": ["Madame Pernelle expresses her discontent with the household, especially with her daughter-in-law Elmire, leading to tension and arguments among the family members and servants.

And after more than two thousand years the same\n discussions continue, philosophers are still ranged under the same\n contending banners, and neither thinkers nor mankind at large seem\n nearer to being unanimous on the subject, than when the youth Socrates\n listened to the old Protagoras, and asserted (if Plato's dialogue be\n grounded on a real conversation) the theory of utilitarianism against\n the popular morality of the so-called sophist. It is true that similar confusion and uncertainty, and in some cases\n similar discordance, exist respecting the first principles of all the\n sciences, not excepting that which is deemed the most certain of them,\n mathematics; without much impairing, generally indeed without impairing\n at all, the trustworthiness of the conclusions of those sciences. An\n apparent anomaly, the explanation of which is, that the detailed\n doctrines of a science are not usually deduced from, nor depend for\n their evidence upon, what are called its first principles. Were it not\n so, there would be no science more precarious, or whose conclusions were\n more insufficiently made out, than algebra; which derives none of its\n certainty from what are commonly taught to learners as its elements,\n since these, as laid down by some of its most eminent teachers, are as\n full of fictions as English law, and of mysteries as theology. The\n truths which are ultimately accepted as the first principles of a\n science, are really the last results of metaphysical analysis, practised\n on the elementary notions with which the science is conversant; and\n their relation to the science is not that of foundations to an edifice,\n but of roots to a tree, which may perform their office equally well\n though they be never dug down to and exposed to light. But though in\n science the particular truths precede the general theory, the contrary\n might be expected to be the case with a practical art, such as morals or\n legislation. All action is for the sake of some end, and rules of\n action, it seems natural to suppose, must take their whole character\n and colour from the end to which they are subservient. When we engage in\n a pursuit, a clear and precise conception of what we are pursuing would\n seem to be the first thing we need, instead of the last we are to look\n forward to. A test of right and wrong must be the means, one would\n think, of ascertaining what is right or wrong, and not a consequence of\n having already ascertained it. The difficulty is not avoided by having recourse to the popular theory\n of a natural faculty, a sense or instinct, informing us of right and\n wrong. For--besides that the existence of such a moral instinct is\n itself one of the matters in dispute--those believers in it who have any\n pretensions to philosophy, have been obliged to abandon the idea that it\n discerns what is right or wrong in the particular case in hand, as our\n other senses discern the sight or sound actually present. Our moral\n faculty, according to all those of its interpreters who are entitled to\n the name of thinkers, supplies us only with the general principles of\n moral judgments; it is a branch of our reason, not of our sensitive\n faculty; and must be looked to for the abstract doctrines of morality,\n not for perception of it in the concrete. The intuitive, no less than\n what may be termed the inductive, school of ethics, insists on the\n necessity of general laws. They both agree that the morality of an\n individual action is not a question of direct perception, but of the\n application of a law to an individual case. They recognise also, to a\n great extent, the same moral laws; but differ as to their evidence, and\n the source from which they derive their authority. According to the one\n opinion, the principles of morals are evident _a priori_, requiring\n nothing to command assent, except that the meaning of the terms be\n understood. According to the other doctrine, right and wrong, as well as\n truth and falsehood, are questions of observation and experience. But\n both hold equally that morality must be deduced from principles; and the\n intuitive school affirm as strongly as the inductive, that there is a\n science of morals. Yet they seldom attempt to make out a list of the _a\n priori_ principles which are to serve as the premises of the science;\n still more rarely do they make any effort to reduce those various\n principles to one first principle, or common ground of obligation. They\n either assume the ordinary precepts of morals as of _a priori_\n authority, or they lay down as the common groundwork of those maxims,\n some generality much less obviously authoritative than the maxims\n themselves, and which has never succeeded in gaining popular acceptance. Yet to support their pretensions there ought either to be some one\n fundamental principle or law, at the root of all morality, or if there\n be several, there should be a determinate order of precedence among\n them; and the one principle, or the rule for deciding between the\n various principles when they conflict, ought to be self-evident. To inquire how far the bad effects of this deficiency have been\n mitigated in practice, or to what extent the moral beliefs of mankind\n have been vitiated or made uncertain by the absence of any distinct\n recognition of an ultimate standard, would imply a complete survey and\n criticism of past and present ethical doctrine. It would, however, be\n easy to show that whatever steadiness or consistency these moral beliefs\n have attained, has been mainly due to the tacit influence of a standard\n not recognised. Although the non-existence of an acknowledged first\n principle has made ethics not so much a guide as a consecration of men's\n actual sentiments, still, as men's sentiments, both of favour and of\n aversion, are greatly influenced by what they suppose to be the effects\n of things upon their happiness, the principle of utility, or as Bentham\n latterly called it, the greatest happiness principle, has had a large\n share in forming the moral doctrines even of those who most scornfully\n reject its authority. Nor is there any school of thought which refuses\n to admit that the influence of actions on happiness is a most material\n and even predominant consideration in many of the details of morals,\n however unwilling to acknowledge it as the fundamental principle of\n morality, and the source of moral obligation. I might go much further,\n and say that to all those _a priori_ moralists who deem it necessary to\n argue at all, utilitarian arguments are indispensable. It is not my\n present purpose to criticise these thinkers; but I cannot help\n referring, for illustration, to a systematic treatise by one of the most\n illustrious of them, the _Metaphysics of Ethics_, by Kant. This\n remarkable man, whose system of thought will long remain one of the\n landmarks in the history of philosophical speculation, does, in the\n treatise in question, lay down an universal first principle as the\n origin and ground of moral obligation; it is this:--'So act, that the\n rule on which thou actest would admit of being adopted as a law by all\n rational beings.' But when he begins to deduce from this precept any of\n the actual duties of morality, he fails, almost grotesquely, to show\n that there would be any contradiction, any logical (not to say\n physical) impossibility, in the adoption by all rational beings of the\n most outrageously immoral rules of conduct. All he shows is that the\n _consequences_ of their universal adoption would be such as no one would\n choose to incur. On the present occasion, I shall, without further discussion of the\n other theories, attempt to contribute something towards the\n understanding and appreciation of the Utilitarian or Happiness theory,\n and towards such proof as it is susceptible of. It is evident that this\n cannot be proof in the ordinary and popular meaning of the term. Questions of ultimate ends are not amenable to direct proof. Whatever\n can be proved to be good, must be so by being shown to be a means to\n something admitted to be good without proof. The medical art is proved\n to be good, by its conducing to health; but how is it possible to prove\n that health is good? The art of music is good, for the reason, among\n others, that it produces pleasure; but what proof is it possible to give\n that pleasure is good? If, then, it is asserted that there is a\n comprehensive formula, including all things which are in themselves\n good, and that whatever else is good, is not so as an end, but as a\n mean, the formula may be accepted or rejected, but is not a subject of\n what is commonly understood by proof. We are not, however, to infer that\n its acceptance or rejection must depend on blind impulse, or arbitrary\n choice. There is a larger meaning of the word proof, in which this\n question is as amenable to it as any other of the disputed questions of\n philosophy. The subject is within the cognizance of the rational\n faculty; and neither does that faculty deal with it solely in the way\n of intuition. Considerations may be presented capable of determining the\n intellect either to give or withhold its assent to the doctrine; and\n this is equivalent to proof. We shall examine presently of what nature are these considerations; in\n what manner they apply to the case, and what rational grounds,\n therefore, can be given for accepting or rejecting the utilitarian\n formula. But it is a preliminary condition of rational acceptance or\n rejection, that the formula should be correctly understood. I believe\n that the very imperfect notion ordinarily formed of its meaning, is the\n chief obstacle which impedes its reception; and that could it be\n cleared, even from only the grosser misconceptions, the question would\n be greatly simplified, and a large proportion of its difficulties\n removed. Before, therefore, I attempt to enter into the philosophical\n grounds which can be given for assenting to the utilitarian standard, I\n shall offer some illustrations of the doctrine itself; with the view of\n showing more clearly what it is, distinguishing it from what it is not,\n and disposing of such of the practical objections to it as either\n originate in, or are closely connected with, mistaken interpretations of\n its meaning. Having thus prepared the ground, I shall afterwards\n endeavour to throw such light as I can upon the question, considered as\n one of philosophical theory. A passing remark is all that needs be given to the ignorant blunder of\n supposing that those who stand up for utility as the test of right and\n wrong, use the term in that restricted and merely colloquial sense in\n which utility is opposed to pleasure. An apology is due to the\n philosophical opponents of utilitarianism, for even the momentary\n appearance of confounding them with any one capable of so absurd a\n misconception; which is the more extraordinary, inasmuch as the contrary\n accusation, of referring everything to pleasure, and that too in its\n grossest form, is another of the common charges against utilitarianism:\n and, as has been pointedly remarked by an able writer, the same sort of\n persons, and often the very same persons, denounce the theory \"as\n impracticably dry when the word utility precedes the word pleasure, and\n as too practicably voluptuous when the word pleasure precedes the word\n utility.\" Those who know anything about the matter are aware that every\n writer, from Epicurus to Bentham, who maintained the theory of utility,\n meant by it, not something to be contradistinguished from pleasure, but\n pleasure itself, together with exemption from pain; and instead of\n opposing the useful to the agreeable or the ornamental, have always\n declared that the useful means these, among other things. Yet the\n common herd, including the herd of writers, not only in newspapers and\n periodicals, but in books of weight and pretension, are perpetually\n falling into this shallow mistake. Having caught up the word\n utilitarian, while knowing nothing whatever about it but its sound, they\n habitually express by it the rejection, or the neglect, of pleasure in\n some of its forms; of beauty, of ornament, or of amusement. Nor is the\n term thus ignorantly misapplied solely in disparagement, but\n occasionally in compliment; as though it implied superiority to\n frivolity and the mere pleasures of the moment. And this perverted use\n is the only one in which the word is popularly known, and the one from\n which the new generation are acquiring their sole notion of its meaning. Those who introduced the word, but who had for many years discontinued\n it as a distinctive appellation, may well feel themselves called upon to\n resume it, if by doing so they can hope to contribute anything towards\n rescuing it from this utter degradation. [A]\n \n The creed which accepts as the foundation of morals, Utility, or the\n Greatest Happiness Principle, holds that actions are right in proportion\n as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the\n reverse of happiness.", "By happiness is intended pleasure , and the absence of pain ; by unhappiness , pain , and the privation of pleasure . To give a clear view of the moral standard set up by the theory , much more requires to be said ; in particular , what things it includes in the ideas of pain and pleasure ; and to what extent this is left an open question . But these supplementary explanations do not affect the theory of life on which this theory of morality is grounded -- namely , that pleasure , and freedom from pain , are the only things desirable as ends ; and that all desirable things ( which are as numerous in the utilitarian as in any other scheme ) are desirable either for the pleasure inherent in themselves , or as means to the promotion of pleasure and the prevention of pain . Now , such a theory of life excites in many minds , and among them in some of the most estimable in feeling and purpose , inveterate dislike . To suppose that life has ( as they express it ) no higher end than pleasure -- no better and nobler object of desire and pursuit -- they designate as utterly mean and grovelling ; as a doctrine worthy only of swine , to whom the followers of Epicurus were , at a very early period , contemptuously likened ; and modern holders of the doctrine are occasionally made the subject of equally polite comparisons by its German , French , and English assailants . When thus attacked , the Epicureans have always answered , that it is not they , but their accusers , who represent human nature in a degrading light ; since the accusation supposes human beings to be capable of no pleasures except those of which swine are capable . If this supposition were true , the charge could not be gainsaid , but would then be no longer an imputation ; for if the sources of pleasure were precisely the same to human beings and to swine , the rule of life which is good enough for the one would be good enough for the other . The comparison of the Epicurean life to that of beasts is felt as degrading , precisely because a beast 's pleasures do not satisfy a human being 's conceptions of happiness . Human beings have faculties more elevated than the animal appetites , and when once made conscious of them , do not regard anything as happiness which does not include their gratification . I do not , indeed , consider the Epicureans to have been by any means faultless in drawing out their scheme of consequences from the utilitarian principle . To do this in any sufficient manner , many Stoic , as well as Christian elements require to be included . But there is no known Epicurean theory of life which does not assign to the pleasures of the intellect ; of the feelings and imagination , and of the moral sentiments , a much higher value as pleasures than to those of mere sensation . It must be admitted , however , that utilitarian writers in general have placed the superiority of mental over bodily pleasures chiefly in the greater permanency , safety , uncostliness , & c. , of the former -- that is , in their circumstantial advantages rather than in their intrinsic nature . And on all these points utilitarians have fully proved their case ; but they might have taken the other , and , as it may be called , higher ground , with entire consistency . It is quite compatible with the principle of utility to recognise the fact , that some _kinds_ of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable than others . It would be absurd that while , in estimating all other things , quality is considered as well as quantity , the estimation of pleasures should be supposed to depend on quantity alone . If I am asked , what I mean by difference of quality in pleasures , or what makes one pleasure more valuable than another , merely as a pleasure , except its being greater in amount , there is but one possible answer . Of two pleasures , if there be one to which all or almost all who have experience of both give a decided preference , irrespective of any feeling of moral obligation to prefer it , that is the more desirable pleasure . If one of the two is , by those who are competently acquainted with both , placed so far above the other that they prefer it , even though knowing it to be attended with a greater amount of discontent , and would not resign it for any quantity of the other pleasure which their nature is capable of , we are justified in ascribing to the preferred enjoyment a superiority in quality , so far outweighing quantity as to render it , in comparison , of small account . Now it is an unquestionable fact that those who are equally acquainted with , and equally capable of appreciating and enjoying , both , do give a most marked preference to the manner of existence which employs their higher faculties . Few human creatures would consent to be changed into any of the lower animals , for a promise of the fullest allowance of a beast 's pleasures ; no intelligent human being would consent to be a fool , no instructed person would be an ignoramus , no person of feeling and conscience would be selfish and base , even though they should be persuaded that the fool , the dunce , or the rascal is better satisfied with his lot than they are with theirs . They would not resign what they possess more than he , for the most complete satisfaction of all the desires which they have in common with him . If they ever fancy they would , it is only in cases of unhappiness so extreme , that to escape from it they would exchange their lot for almost any other , however undesirable in their own eyes . A being of higher faculties requires more to make him happy , is capable probably of more acute suffering , and is certainly accessible to it at more points , than one of an inferior type ; but in spite of these liabilities , he can never really wish to sink into what he feels to be a lower grade of existence . We may give what explanation we please of this unwillingness ; we may attribute it to pride , a name which is given indiscriminately to some of the most and to some of the least estimable feelings of which mankind are capable ; we may refer it to the love of liberty and personal independence , an appeal to which was with the Stoics one of the most effective means for the inculcation of it ; to the love of power , or to the love of excitement , both of which do really enter into and contribute to it : but its most appropriate appellation is a sense of dignity , which all human beings possess in one form or other , and in some , though by no means in exact , proportion to their higher faculties , and which is so essential a part of the happiness of those in whom it is strong , that nothing which conflicts with it could be , otherwise than momentarily , an object of desire to them . Whoever supposes that this preference takes place at a sacrifice of happiness-that the superior being , in anything like equal circumstances , is not happier than the inferior-confounds the two very different ideas , of happiness , and content . It is indisputable that the being whose capacities of enjoyment are low , has the greatest chance of having them fully satisfied ; and a highly-endowed being will always feel that any happiness which he can look for , as the world is constituted , is imperfect . But he can learn to bear its imperfections , if they are at all bearable ; and they will not make him envy the being who is indeed unconscious of the imperfections , but only because he feels not at all the good which those imperfections qualify . It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied ; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied . And if the fool , or the pig , is of a different opinion , it is because they only know their own side of the question . The other party to the comparison knows both sides . It may be objected , that many who are capable of the higher pleasures , occasionally , under the influence of temptation , postpone them to the lower . But this is quite compatible with a full appreciation of the intrinsic superiority of the higher . Men often , from infirmity of character , make their election for the nearer good , though they know it to be the less valuable ; and this no less when the choice is between two bodily pleasures , than when it is between bodily and mental . They pursue sensual indulgences to the injury of health , though perfectly aware that health is the greater good . It may be further objected , that many who begin with youthful enthusiasm for everything noble , as they advance in years sink into indolence and selfishness . But I do not believe that those who undergo this very common change , voluntarily choose the lower description of pleasures in preference to the higher . I believe that before they devote themselves exclusively to the one , they have already become incapable of the other . Capacity for the nobler feelings is in most natures a very tender plant , easily killed , not only by hostile influences , but by mere want of sustenance ; and in the majority of young persons it speedily dies away if the occupations to which their position in life has devoted them , and the society into which it has thrown them , are not favourable to keeping that higher capacity in exercise . Men lose their high aspirations as they lose their intellectual tastes , because they have not time or opportunity for indulging them ; and they addict themselves to inferior pleasures , not because they deliberately prefer them , but because they are either the only ones to which they have access , or the only ones which they are any longer capable of enjoying . It may be questioned whether any one who has remained equally susceptible to both classes of pleasures , ever knowingly and calmly preferred the lower ; though many , in all ages , have broken down in an ineffectual attempt to combine both . From this verdict of the only competent judges , I apprehend there can be no appeal . On a question which is the best worth having of two pleasures , or which of two modes of existence is the most grateful to the feelings , apart from its moral attributes and from its consequences , the judgment of those who are qualified by knowledge of both , or , if they differ , that of the majority among them , must be admitted as final . And there needs be the less hesitation to accept this judgment respecting the quality of pleasures , since there is no other tribunal to be referred to even on the question of quantity . What means are there of determining which is the acutest of two pains , or the intensest of two pleasurable sensations , except the general suffrage of those who are familiar with both ? Neither pains nor pleasures are homogeneous , and pain is always heterogeneous with pleasure . What is there to decide whether a particular pleasure is worth purchasing at the cost of a particular pain , except the feelings and judgment of the experienced ? When , therefore , those feelings and judgment declare the pleasures derived from the higher faculties to be preferable _in kind_ , apart from the question of intensity , to those of which the animal nature , disjoined from the higher faculties , is susceptible , they are entitled on this subject to the same regard . I have dwelt on this point , as being a necessary part of a perfectly just conception of Utility or Happiness , considered as the directive rule of human conduct . But it is by no means an indispensable condition to the acceptance of the utilitarian standard ; for that standard is not the agent 's own greatest happiness , but the greatest amount of happiness altogether ; and if it may possibly be doubted whether a noble character is always the happier for its nobleness , there can be no doubt that it makes other people happier , and that the world in general is immensely a gainer by it . Utilitarianism , therefore , could only attain its end by the general cultivation of nobleness of character , even if each individual were only benefited by the nobleness of others , and his own , so far as happiness is concerned , were a sheer deduction from the benefit . But the bare enunciation of such an absurdity as this last , renders refutation superfluous . According to the Greatest Happiness Principle , as above explained , the ultimate end , with reference to and for the sake of which all other things are desirable ( whether we are considering our own good or that of other people ) , is an existence exempt as far as possible from pain , and as rich as possible in enjoyments , both in point of quantity and quality ; the test of quality , and the rule for measuring it against quantity , being the preference felt by those who , in their opportunities of experience , to which must be added their habits of self-consciousness and self-observation , are best furnished with the means of comparison . This , being , according to the utilitarian opinion , the end of human action , is necessarily also the standard of morality ; which may accordingly be defined , the rules and precepts for human conduct , by the observance of which an existence such as has been described might be , to the greatest extent possible , secured to all mankind ; and not to them only , but , so far as the nature of things admits , to the", "whole sentient creation . Against this doctrine , however , arises another class of objectors , who say that happiness , in any form , can not be the rational purpose of human life and action ; because , in the first place , it is unattainable : and they contemptuously ask , What right hast thou to be happy ? a question which Mr. Carlyle clenches by the addition , What right , a short time ago , hadst thou even _to be_ ? Next , they say , that men can do _without_ happiness ; that all noble human beings have felt this , and could not have become noble but by learning the lesson of Entsagen , or renunciation ; which lesson , thoroughly learnt and submitted to , they affirm to be the beginning and necessary condition of all virtue . The first of these objections would go to the root of the matter were it well founded ; for if no happiness is to be had at all by human beings , the attainment of it can not be the end of morality , or of any rational conduct . Though , even in that case , something might still be said for the utilitarian theory ; since utility includes not solely the pursuit of happiness , but the prevention or mitigation of unhappiness ; and if the former aim be chimerical , there will be all the greater scope and more imperative need for the latter , so long at least as mankind think fit to live , and do not take refuge in the simultaneous act of suicide recommended under certain conditions by Novalis . When , however , it is thus positively asserted to be impossible that human life should be happy , the assertion , if not something like a verbal quibble , is at least an exaggeration . If by happiness be meant a continuity of highly pleasurable excitement , it is evident enough that this is impossible . A state of exalted pleasure lasts only moments , or in some cases , and with some intermissions , hours or days , and is the occasional brilliant flash of enjoyment , not its permanent and steady flame . Of this the philosophers who have taught that happiness is the end of life were as fully aware as those who taunt them . The happiness which they meant was not a life of rapture , but moments of such , in an existence made up of few and transitory pains , many and various pleasures , with a decided predominance of the active over the passive , and having as the foundation of the whole , not to expect more from life than it is capable of bestowing . A life thus composed , to those who have been fortunate enough to obtain it , has always appeared worthy of the name of happiness . And such an existence is even now the lot of many , during some considerable portion of their lives . The present wretched education , and wretched social arrangements , are the only real hindrance to its being attainable by almost all . The objectors perhaps may doubt whether human beings , if taught to consider happiness as the end of life , would be satisfied with such a moderate share of it . But great numbers of mankind have been satisfied with much less . The main constituents of a satisfied life appear to be two , either of which by itself is often found sufficient for the purpose : tranquillity , and excitement . With much tranquillity , many find that they can be content with very little pleasure : with much excitement , many can reconcile themselves to a considerable quantity of pain . There is assuredly no inherent impossibility in enabling even the mass of mankind to unite both ; since the two are so far from being incompatible that they are in natural alliance , the prolongation of either being a preparation for , and exciting a wish for , the other . It is only those in whom indolence amounts to a vice , that do not desire excitement after an interval of repose ; it is only those in whom the need of excitement is a disease , that feel the tranquillity which follows excitement dull and insipid , instead of pleasurable in direct proportion to the excitement which preceded it . When people who are tolerably fortunate in their outward lot do not find in life sufficient enjoyment to make it valuable to them , the cause generally is , caring for nobody but themselves . To those who have neither public nor private affections , the excitements of life are much curtailed , and in any case dwindle in value as the time approaches when all selfish interests must be terminated by death : while those who leave after them objects of personal affection , and especially those who have also cultivated a fellow-feeling with the collective interests of mankind , retain as lively an interest in life on the eve of death as in the vigour of youth and health . Next to selfishness , the principal cause which makes life unsatisfactory , is want of mental cultivation . A cultivated mind -- I do not mean that of a philosopher , but any mind to which the fountains of knowledge have been opened , and which has been taught , in any tolerable degree , to exercise its faculties -- finds sources of inexhaustible interest in all that surrounds it ; in the objects of nature , the achievements of art , the imaginations of poetry , the incidents of history , the ways of mankind past and present , and their prospects in the future . It is possible , indeed , to become indifferent to all this , and that too without having exhausted a thousandth part of it ; but only when one has had from the beginning no moral or human interest in these things , and has sought in them only the gratification of curiosity . Now there is absolutely no reason in the nature of things why an amount of mental culture sufficient to give an intelligent interest in these objects of contemplation , should not be the inheritance of every one born in a civilized country . As little is there an inherent necessity that any human being should be a selfish egotist , devoid of every feeling or care but those which centre in his own miserable individuality . Something far superior to this is sufficiently common even now , to give ample earnest of what the human species may be made . Genuine private affections , and a sincere interest in the public good , are possible , though in unequal degrees , to every rightly brought-up human being . In a world in which there is so much to interest , so much to enjoy , and so much also to correct and improve , every one who has this moderate amount of moral and intellectual requisites is capable of an existence which may be called enviable ; and unless such a person , through bad laws , or subjection to the will of others , is denied the liberty to use the sources of happiness within his reach , he will not fail to find this enviable existence , if he escape the positive evils of life , the great sources of physical and mental suffering -- such as indigence , disease , and the unkindness , worthlessness , or premature loss of objects of affection . The main stress of the problem lies , therefore , in the contest with these calamities , from which it is a rare good fortune entirely to escape ; which , as things now are , can not be obviated , and often can not be in any material degree mitigated . Yet no one whose opinion deserves a moment 's consideration can doubt that most of the great positive evils of the world are in themselves removable , and will , if human affairs continue to improve , be in the end reduced within narrow limits . Poverty , in any sense implying suffering , may be completely extinguished by the wisdom of society , combined with the good sense and providence of individuals . Even that most intractable of enemies , disease , may be indefinitely reduced in dimensions by good physical and moral education , and proper control of noxious influences ; while the progress of science holds out a promise for the future of still more direct conquests over this detestable foe . And every advance in that direction relieves us from some , not only of the chances which cut short our own lives , but , what concerns us still more , which deprive us of those in whom our happiness is wrapt up . As for vicissitudes of fortune , and other disappointments connected with worldly circumstances , these are principally the effect either of gross imprudence , of ill-regulated desires , or of bad or imperfect social institutions . All the grand sources , in short , of human suffering are in a great degree , many of them almost entirely , conquerable by human care and effort ; and though their removal is grievously slow -- though a long succession of generations will perish in the breach before the conquest is completed , and this world becomes all that , if will and knowledge were not wanting , it might easily be made -- yet every mind sufficiently intelligent and generous to bear a part , however small and unconspicuous , in the endeavour , will draw a noble enjoyment from the contest itself , which he would not for any bribe in the form of selfish indulgence consent to be without . And this leads to the true estimation of what is said by the objectors concerning the possibility , and the obligation , of learning to do without happiness . Unquestionably it is possible to do without happiness ; it is done involuntarily by nineteen-twentieths of mankind , even in those parts of our present world which are least deep in barbarism ; and it often has to be done voluntarily by the hero or the martyr , for the sake of something which he prizes more than his individual happiness . But this something , what is it , unless the happiness of others , or some of the requisites of happiness ? It is noble to be capable of resigning entirely one 's own portion of happiness , or chances of it : but , after all , this self-sacrifice must be for some end ; it is not its own end ; and if we are told that its end is not happiness , but virtue , which is better than happiness , I ask , would the sacrifice be made if the hero or martyr did not believe that it would earn for others immunity from similar sacrifices ? Would it be made , if he thought that his renunciation of happiness for himself would produce no fruit for any of his fellow creatures , but to make their lot like his , and place them also in the condition of persons who have renounced happiness ? All honour to those who can abnegate for themselves the personal enjoyment of life , when by such renunciation they contribute worthily to increase the amount of happiness in the world ; but he who does it , or professes to do it , for any other purpose , is no more deserving of admiration than the ascetic mounted on his pillar . He may be an inspiriting proof of what men _can_ do , but assuredly not an example of what they _should_ . Though it is only in a very imperfect state of the world 's arrangements that any one can best serve the happiness of others by the absolute sacrifice of his own , yet so long as the world is in that imperfect state , I fully acknowledge that the readiness to make such a sacrifice is the highest virtue which can be found in man . I will add , that in this condition of the world , paradoxical as the assertion may be , the conscious ability to do without happiness gives the best prospect of realizing such happiness as is attainable . For nothing except that consciousness can raise a person above the chances of life , by making him feel that , let fate and fortune do their worst , they have not power to subdue him : which , once felt , frees him from excess of anxiety concerning the evils of life , and enables him , like many a Stoic in the worst times of the Roman Empire , to cultivate in tranquillity the sources of satisfaction accessible to him , without concerning himself about the uncertainty of their duration , any more than about their inevitable end . Meanwhile , let utilitarians never cease to claim the morality of self-devotion as a possession which belongs by as good a right to them , as either to the Stoic or to the Transcendentalist . The utilitarian morality does recognise in human beings the power of sacrificing their own greatest good for the good of others . It only refuses to admit that the sacrifice is itself a good . A sacrifice which does not increase , or tend to increase , the sum total of happiness , it considers as wasted . The only self-renunciation which it applauds , is devotion to the happiness , or to some of the means of happiness , of others ; either of mankind collectively , or of individuals within the limits imposed by the collective interests of mankind . I must again repeat , what the assailants of utilitarianism seldom have the justice to acknowledge , that the happiness which forms the utilitarian standard of what is right in conduct , is not the agent 's own happiness , but that of all concerned . As between his own happiness and that of others , utilitarianism requires him to be as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator . In the golden rule of Jesus of Nazareth , we read the complete spirit of the ethics of utility . To do as one would be done by , and to love one 's neighbour as oneself , constitute the ideal perfection of utilitarian morality . As the means of making the nearest approach to this ideal , utility would enjoin , first , that laws and social arrangements should place the happiness , or ( as", "speaking practically it may be called ) the interest , of every individual , as nearly as possible in harmony with the interest of the whole ; and secondly , that education and opinion , which have so vast a power over human character , should so use that power as to establish in the mind of every individual an indissoluble association between his own happiness and the good of the whole ; especially between his own happiness and the practice of such modes of conduct , negative and positive , as regard for the universal happiness prescribes : so that not only he may be unable to conceive the possibility of happiness to himself , consistently with conduct opposed to the general good , but also that a direct impulse to promote the general good may be in every individual one of the habitual motives of action , and the sentiments connected therewith may fill a large and prominent place in every human being 's sentient existence . If the impugners of the utilitarian morality represented it to their own minds in this its true character , I know not what recommendation possessed by any other morality they could possibly affirm to be wanting to it : what more beautiful or more exalted developments of human nature any other ethical system can be supposed to foster , or what springs of action , not accessible to the utilitarian , such systems rely on for giving effect to their mandates . The objectors to utilitarianism can not always be charged with representing it in a discreditable light . On the contrary , those among them who entertain anything like a just idea of its disinterested character , sometimes find fault with its standard as being too high for humanity . They say it is exacting too much to require that people shall always act from the inducement of promoting the general interests of society . But this is to mistake the very meaning of a standard of morals , and to confound the rule of action with the motive of it . It is the business of ethics to tell us what are our duties , or by what test we may know them ; but no system of ethics requires that the sole motive of all we do shall be a feeling of duty ; on the contrary , ninety-nine hundredths of all our actions are done from other motives , and rightly so done , if the rule of duty does not condemn them . It is the more unjust to utilitarianism that this particular misapprehension should be made a ground of objection to it , inasmuch as utilitarian moralists have gone beyond almost all others in affirming that the motive has nothing to do with the morality of the action , though much with the worth of the agent . He who saves a fellow creature from drowning does what is morally right , whether his motive be duty , or the hope of being paid for his trouble : he who betrays the friend that trusts him , is guilty of a crime , even if his object be to serve another friend to whom he is under greater obligations . [ B ] But to speak only of actions done from the motive of duty , and in direct obedience to principle : it is a misapprehension of the utilitarian mode of thought , to conceive it as implying that people should fix their minds upon so wide a generality as the world , or society at large . The great majority of good actions are intended , not for the benefit of the world , but for that of individuals , of which the good of the world is made up ; and the thoughts of the most virtuous man need not on these occasions travel beyond the particular persons concerned , except so far as is necessary to assure himself that in benefiting them he is not violating the rights -- that is , the legitimate and authorized expectations -- of any one else . The multiplication of happiness is , according to the utilitarian ethics , the object of virtue : the occasions on which any person ( except one in a thousand ) has it in his power to do this on an extended scale , in other words , to be a public benefactor , are but exceptional ; and on these occasions alone is he called on to consider public utility ; in every other case , private utility , the interest or happiness of some few persons , is all he has to attend to . Those alone the influence of whose actions extends to society in general , need concern themselves habitually about so large an object . In the case of abstinences indeed -- of things which people forbear to do , from moral considerations , though the consequences in the particular case might be beneficial -- it would be unworthy of an intelligent agent not to be consciously aware that the action is of a class which , if practised generally , would be generally injurious , and that this is the ground of the obligation to abstain from it . The amount of regard for the public interest implied in this recognition , is no greater than is demanded by every system of morals ; for they all enjoin to abstain from whatever is manifestly pernicious to society . The same considerations dispose of another reproach against the doctrine of utility , founded on a still grosser misconception of the purpose of a standard of morality , and of the very meaning of the words right and wrong . It is often affirmed that utilitarianism renders men cold and unsympathizing ; that it chills their moral feelings towards individuals ; that it makes them regard only the dry and hard consideration of the consequences of actions , not taking into their moral estimate the qualities from which those actions emanate . If the assertion means that they do not allow their judgment respecting the rightness or wrongness of an action to be influenced by their opinion of the qualities of the person who does it , this is a complaint not against utilitarianism , but against having any standard of morality at all ; for certainly no known ethical standard decides an action to be good or bad because it is done by a good or a bad man , still less because done by an amiable , a brave , or a benevolent man or the contrary . These considerations are relevant , not to the estimation of actions , but of persons ; and there is nothing in the utilitarian theory inconsistent with the fact that there are other things which interest us in persons besides the rightness and wrongness of their actions . The Stoics , indeed , with the paradoxical misuse of language which was part of their system , and by which they strove to raise themselves above all concern about anything but virtue , were fond of saying that he who has that has everything ; that he , and only he , is rich , is beautiful , is a king . But no claim of this description is made for the virtuous man by the utilitarian doctrine . Utilitarians are quite aware that there are other desirable possessions and qualities besides virtue , and are perfectly willing to allow to all of them their full worth . They are also aware that a right action does not necessarily indicate a virtuous character , and that actions which are blameable often proceed from qualities entitled to praise . When this is apparent in any particular case , it modifies their estimation , not certainly of the act , but of the agent . I grant that they are , notwithstanding , of opinion , that in the long run the best proof of a good character is good actions ; and resolutely refuse to consider any mental disposition as good , of which the predominant tendency is to produce bad conduct . This makes them unpopular with many people ; but it is an unpopularity which they must share with every one who regards the distinction between right and wrong in a serious light ; and the reproach is not one which a conscientious utilitarian need be anxious to repel . If no more be meant by the objection than that many utilitarians look on the morality of actions , as measured by the utilitarian standard , with too exclusive a regard , and do not lay sufficient stress upon the other beauties of character which go towards making a human being loveable or admirable , this may be admitted . Utilitarians who have cultivated their moral feelings , but not their sympathies nor their artistic perceptions , do fall into this mistake ; and so do all other moralists under the same conditions . What can be said in excuse for other moralists is equally available for them , namely , that if there is to be any error , it is better that it should be on that side . As a matter of fact , we may affirm that among utilitarians as among adherents of other systems , there is every imaginable degree of rigidity and of laxity in the application of their standard : some are even puritanically rigorous , while others are as indulgent as can possibly be desired by sinner or by sentimentalist . But on the whole , a doctrine which brings prominently forward the interest that mankind have in the repression and prevention of conduct which violates the moral law , is likely to be inferior to no other in turning the sanctions of opinion against such violations . It is true , the question , What does violate the moral law ? is one on which those who recognise different standards of morality are likely now and then to differ . But difference of opinion on moral questions was not first introduced into the world by utilitarianism , while that doctrine does supply , if not always an easy , at all events a tangible and intelligible mode of deciding such differences . * * * * * It may not be superfluous to notice a few more of the common misapprehensions of utilitarian ethics , even those which are so obvious and gross that it might appear impossible for any person of candour and intelligence to fall into them : since persons , even of considerable mental endowments , often give themselves so little trouble to understand the bearings of any opinion against which they entertain a prejudice , and men are in general so little conscious of this voluntary ignorance as a defect , that the vulgarest misunderstandings of ethical doctrines are continually met with in the deliberate writings of persons of the greatest pretensions both to high principle and to philosophy . We not uncommonly hear the doctrine of utility inveighed against as a _godless_ doctrine . If it be necessary to say anything at all against so mere an assumption , we may say that the question depends upon what idea we have formed of the moral character of the Deity . If it be a true belief that God desires , above all things , the happiness of his creatures , and that this was his purpose in their creation , utility is not only not a godless doctrine , but more profoundly religious than any other . If it be meant that utilitarianism does not recognise the revealed will of God as the supreme law of morals , I answer , that an utilitarian who believes in the perfect goodness and wisdom of God , necessarily believes that whatever God has thought fit to reveal on the subject of morals , must fulfil the requirements of utility in a supreme degree . But others besides utilitarians have been of opinion that the Christian revelation was intended , and is fitted , to inform the hearts and minds of mankind with a spirit which should enable them to find for themselves what is right , and incline them to do it when found , rather than to tell them , except in a very general way , what it is : and that we need a doctrine of ethics , carefully followed out , to _interpret_ to us the will of God . Whether this opinion is correct or not , it is superfluous here to discuss ; since whatever aid religion , either natural or revealed , can afford to ethical investigation , is as open to the utilitarian moralist as to any other . He can use it as the testimony of God to the usefulness or hurtfulness of any given course of action , by as good a right as others can use it for the indication of a transcendental law , having no connexion with usefulness or with happiness . Again , Utility is often summarily stigmatized as an immoral doctrine by giving it the name of Expediency , and taking advantage of the popular use of that term to contrast it with Principle . But the Expedient , in the sense in which it is opposed to the Right , generally means that which is expedient for the particular interest of the agent himself : as when a minister sacrifices the interest of his country to keep himself in place . When it means anything better than this , it means that which is expedient for some immediate object , some temporary purpose , but which violates a rule whose observance is expedient in a much higher degree . The Expedient , in this sense , instead of being the same thing with the useful , is a branch of the hurtful . Thus , it would often be expedient , for the purpose of getting over some momentary embarrassment , or attaining some object immediately useful to ourselves or others , to tell a lie . But inasmuch as the cultivation in ourselves of a sensitive feeling on the subject of veracity , is one of the most useful , and the enfeeblement of that feeling one of the most hurtful , things to which our conduct can be instrumental ; and inasmuch as any , even unintentional , deviation from truth , does that much towards weakening the trustworthiness of human assertion , which is not only the principal support of all present social well-being , but the insufficiency of which does more than any one thing that can be named to keep back civilisation , virtue , everything on which human happiness on the largest scale depends ; we feel that the violation , for", "a present advantage , of a rule of such transcendent expediency , is not expedient , and that he who , for the sake of a convenience to himself or to some other individual , does what depends on him to deprive mankind of the good , and inflict upon them the evil , involved in the greater or less reliance which they can place in each other 's word , acts the part of one of their worst enemies . Yet that even this rule , sacred as it is , admits of possible exceptions , is acknowledged by all moralists ; the chief of which is when the withholding of some fact ( as of information from a male-factor , or of bad news from a person dangerously ill ) would preserve some one ( especially a person other than oneself ) from great and unmerited evil , and when the withholding can only be effected by denial . But in order that the exception may not extend itself beyond the need , and may have the least possible effect in weakening reliance on veracity , it ought to be recognized , and , if possible , its limits defined ; and if the principle of utility is good for anything , it must be good for weighing these conflicting utilities against one another , and marking out the region within which one or the other preponderates . Again , defenders of utility often find themselves called upon to reply to such objections as this -- that there is not time , previous to action , for calculating and weighing the effects of any line of conduct on the general happiness . This is exactly as if any one were to say that it is impossible to guide our conduct by Christianity , because there is not time , on every occasion on which anything has to be done , to read through the Old and New Testaments . The answer to the objection is , that there has been ample time , namely , the whole past duration of the human species . During all that time mankind have been learning by experience the tendencies of actions ; on which experience all the prudence , as well as all the morality of life , is dependent . People talk as if the commencement of this course of experience had hitherto been put off , and as if , at the moment when some man feels tempted to meddle with the property or life of another , he had to begin considering for the first time whether murder and theft are injurious to human happiness . Even then I do not think that he would find the question very puzzling ; but , at all events , the matter is now done to his hand . It is truly a whimsical supposition , that if mankind were agreed in considering utility to be the test of morality , they would remain without any agreement as to what is useful , and would take no measures for having their notions on the subject taught to the young , and enforced by law and opinion . There is no difficulty in proving any ethical standard whatever to work ill , if we suppose universal idiocy to be conjoined with it , but on any hypothesis short of that , mankind must by this time have acquired positive beliefs as to the effects of some actions on their happiness ; and the beliefs which have thus come down are the rules of morality for the multitude , and for the philosopher until he has succeeded in finding better . That philosophers might easily do this , even now , on many subjects ; that the received code of ethics is by no means of divine right ; and that mankind have still much to learn as to the effects of actions on the general happiness , I admit , or rather , earnestly maintain . The corollaries from the principle of utility , like the precepts of every practical art , admit of indefinite improvement , and , in a progressive state of the human mind , their improvement is perpetually going on . But to consider the rules of morality as improvable , is one thing ; to pass over the intermediate generalizations entirely , and endeavour to test each individual action directly by the first principle , is another . It is a strange notion that the acknowledgment of a first principle is inconsistent with the admission of secondary ones . To inform a traveller respecting the place of his ultimate destination , is not to forbid the use of landmarks and direction-posts on the way . The proposition that happiness is the end and aim of morality , does not mean that no road ought to be laid down to that goal , or that persons going thither should not be advised to take one direction rather than another . Men really ought to leave off talking a kind of nonsense on this subject , which they would neither talk nor listen to on other matters of practical concernment . Nobody argues that the art of navigation is not founded on astronomy , because sailors can not wait to calculate the Nautical Almanack . Being rational creatures , they go to sea with it ready calculated ; and all rational creatures go out upon the sea of life with their minds made up on the common questions of right and wrong , as well as on many of the far more difficult questions of wise and foolish . And this , as long as foresight is a human quality , it is to be presumed they will continue to do . Whatever we adopt as the fundamental principle of morality , we require subordinate principles to apply it by : the impossibility of doing without them , being common to all systems , can afford no argument against any one in particular : but gravely to argue as if no such secondary principles could be had , and as if mankind had remained till now , and always must remain , without drawing any general conclusions from the experience of human life , is as high a pitch , I think , as absurdity has ever reached in philosophical controversy . The remainder of the stock arguments against utilitarianism mostly consist in laying to its charge the common infirmities of human nature , and the general difficulties which embarrass conscientious persons in shaping their course through life . We are told that an utilitarian will be apt to make his own particular case an exception to moral rules , and , when under temptation , will see an utility in the breach of a rule , greater than he will see in its observance . But is utility the only creed which is able to furnish us with excuses for evil doing , and means of cheating our own conscience ? They are afforded in abundance by all doctrines which recognise as a fact in morals the existence of conflicting considerations ; which all doctrines do , that have been believed by sane persons . It is not the fault of any creed , but of the complicated nature of human affairs , that rules of conduct can not be so framed as to require no exceptions , and that hardly any kind of action can safely be laid down as either always obligatory or always condemnable . There is no ethical creed which does not temper the rigidity of its laws , by giving a certain latitude , under the moral responsibility of the agent , for accommodation to peculiarities of circumstances ; and under every creed , at the opening thus made , self-deception and dishonest casuistry get in . There exists no moral system under which there do not arise unequivocal cases of conflicting obligation . These are the real difficulties , the knotty points both in the theory of ethics , and in the conscientious guidance of personal conduct . They are overcome practically with greater or with less success according to the intellect and virtue of the individual ; but it can hardly be pretended that any one will be the less qualified for dealing with them , from possessing an ultimate standard to which conflicting rights and duties can be referred . If utility is the ultimate source of moral obligations , utility may be invoked to decide between them when their demands are incompatible . Though the application of the standard may be difficult , it is better than none at all : while in other systems , the moral laws all claiming independent authority , there is no common umpire entitled to interfere between them ; their claims to precedence one over another rest on little better than sophistry , and unless determined , as they generally are , by the unacknowledged influence of considerations of utility , afford a free scope for the action of personal desires and partialities . We must remember that only in these cases of conflict between secondary principles is it requisite that first principles should be appealed to . There is no case of moral obligation in which some secondary principle is not involved ; and if only one , there can seldom be any real doubt which one it is , in the mind of any person by whom the principle itself is recognized . FOOTNOTES : [ Footnote A : The author of this essay has reason for believing himself to be the first person who brought the word utilitarian into use . He did not invent it , but adopted it from a passing expression in Mr. Galt's _Annals of the Parish_ . After using it as a designation for several years , he and others abandoned it from a growing dislike to anything resembling a badge or watchword of sectarian distinction . But as a name for one single opinion , not a set of opinions -- to denote the recognition of utility as a standard , not any particular way of applying it -- the term supplies a want in the language , and offers , in many cases , a convenient mode of avoiding tiresome circumlocution . ] [ Footnote B : An opponent , whose intellectual and moral fairness it is a pleasure to acknowledge ( the Rev . J. Llewellyn Davis ) , has objected to this passage , saying , `` Surely the rightness or wrongness of saving a man from drowning does depend very much upon the motive with which it is done . Suppose that a tyrant , when his enemy jumped into the sea to escape from him , saved him from drowning simply in order that he might inflict upon him more exquisite tortures , would it tend to clearness to speak of that rescue as ' a morally right action ? ' Or suppose again , according to one of the stock illustrations of ethical inquiries , that a man betrayed a trust received from a friend , because the discharge of it would fatally injure that friend himself or some one belonging to him , would utilitarianism compel one to call the betrayal ' a crime ' as much as if it had been done from the meanest motive ? '' I submit , that he who saves another from drowning in order to kill him by torture afterwards , does not differ only in motive from him who does the same thing from duty or benevolence ; the act itself is different . The rescue of the man is , in the case supposed , only the necessary first step of an act far more atrocious than leaving him to drown would have been . Had Mr. Davis said , `` The rightness or wrongness of saving a man from drowning does depend very much '' -- not upon the motive , but -- '' upon the _intention_ '' no utilitarian would have differed from him . Mr. Davis , by an oversight too common not to be quite venial , has in this case confounded the very different ideas of Motive and Intention . There is no point which utilitarian thinkers ( and Bentham pre-eminently ) have taken more pains to illustrate than this . The morality of the action depends entirely upon the intention -- that is , upon what the agent _wills to do_ . But the motive , that is , the feeling which makes him will so to do , when it makes no difference in the act , makes none in the morality : though it makes a great difference in our moral estimation of the agent , especially if it indicates a good or a bad habitual _disposition_ -- a bent of character from which useful , or from which hurtful actions are likely to arise . ] The question is often asked , and properly so , in regard to any supposed moral standard -- What is its sanction ? what are the motives to obey it ? or more specifically , what is the source of its obligation ? whence does it derive its binding force ? It is a necessary part of moral philosophy to provide the answer to this question ; which , though frequently assuming the shape of an objection to the utilitarian morality , as if it had some special applicability to that above others , really arises in regard to all standards . It arises , in fact , whenever a person is called on to adopt a standard or refer morality to any basis on which he has not been accustomed to rest it . For the customary morality , that which education and opinion have consecrated , is the only one which presents itself to the mind with the feeling of being _in itself_ obligatory ; and when a person is asked to believe that this morality _derives_ its obligation from some general principle round which custom has not thrown the same halo , the assertion is to him a paradox ; the supposed corollaries seem to have a more binding force than the original theorem ; the superstructure seems to stand better without , than with , what is represented as its foundation . He says to himself , I feel that I am bound not to rob or murder , betray or deceive ; but why am I bound to promote the general happiness ? If my own happiness lies in something else , why may I not give that the preference ? If the view adopted by the utilitarian philosophy of the nature of the moral sense be correct , this difficulty will always present itself , until the", "influences which form moral character have taken the same hold of the principle which they have taken of some of the consequences -- until , by the improvement of education , the feeling of unity with our fellow creatures shall be ( what it can not be doubted that Christ intended it to be ) as deeply rooted in our character , and to our own consciousness as completely a part of our nature , as the horror of crime is in an ordinarily well-brought-up young person . In the mean time , however , the difficulty has no peculiar application to the doctrine of utility , but is inherent in every attempt to analyse morality and reduce it to principles ; which , unless the principle is already in men 's minds invested with as much sacredness as any of its applications , always seems to divest them of a part of their sanctity . The principle of utility either has , or there is no reason why it might not have , all the sanctions which belong to any other system of morals . Those sanctions are either external or internal . Of the external sanctions it is not necessary to speak at any length . They are , the hope of favour and the fear of displeasure from our fellow creatures or from the Ruler of the Universe , along with whatever we may have of sympathy or affection for them or of love and awe of Him , inclining us to do His will independently of selfish consequences . There is evidently no reason why all these motives for observance should not attach themselves to the utilitarian morality , as completely and as powerfully as to any other . Indeed , those of them which refer to our fellow creatures are sure to do so , in proportion to the amount of general intelligence ; for whether there be any other ground of moral obligation than the general happiness or not , men do desire happiness ; and however imperfect may be their own practice , they desire and commend all conduct in others towards themselves , by which they think their happiness is promoted . With regard to the religious motive , if men believe , as most profess to do , in the goodness of God , those who think that conduciveness to the general happiness is the essence , or even only the criterion , of good , must necessarily believe that it is also that which God approves . The whole force therefore of external reward and punishment , whether physical or moral , and whether proceeding from God or from our fellow men , together with all that the capacities of human nature admit , of disinterested devotion to either , become available to enforce the utilitarian morality , in proportion as that morality is recognized ; and the more powerfully , the more the appliances of education and general cultivation are bent to the purpose . So far as to external sanctions . The internal sanction of duty , whatever our standard of duty may be , is one and the same -- a feeling in our own mind ; a pain , more or less intense , attendant on violation of duty , which in properly cultivated moral natures rises , in the more serious cases , into shrinking from it as an impossibility . This feeling , when disinterested , and connecting itself with the pure idea of duty , and not with some particular form of it , or with any of the merely accessory circumstances , is the essence of Conscience ; though in that complex phenomenon as it actually exists , the simple fact is in general all encrusted over with collateral associations , derived from sympathy , from love , and still more from fear ; from all the forms of religious feeling ; from the recollections of childhood and of all our past life ; from self-esteem , desire of the esteem of others , and occasionally even self-abasement . This extreme complication is , I apprehend , the origin of the sort of mystical character which , by a tendency of the human mind of which there are many other examples , is apt to be attributed to the idea of moral obligation , and which leads people to believe that the idea can not possibly attach itself to any other objects than those which , by a supposed mysterious law , are found in our present experience to excite it . Its binding force , however , consists in the existence of a mass of feeling which must be broken through in order to do what violates our standard of right , and which , if we do nevertheless violate that standard , will probably have to be encountered afterwards in the form of remorse . Whatever theory we have of the nature or origin of conscience , this is what essentially constitutes it . The ultimate sanction , therefore , of all morality ( external motives apart ) being a subjective feeling in our own minds , I see nothing embarrassing to those whose standard is utility , in the question , what is the sanction of that particular standard ? We may answer , the same as of all other moral standards -- the conscientious feelings of mankind . Undoubtedly this sanction has no binding efficacy on those who do not possess the feelings it appeals to ; but neither will these persons be more obedient to any other moral principle than to the utilitarian one . On them morality of any kind has no hold but through the external sanctions . Meanwhile the feelings exist , a feet in human nature , the reality of which , and the great power with which they are capable of acting on those in whom they have been duly cultivated , are proved by experience . No reason has ever been shown why they may not be cultivated to as great intensity in connection with the utilitarian , as with any other rule of morals . There is , I am aware , a disposition to believe that a person who sees in moral obligation a transcendental fact , an objective reality belonging to the province of `` Things in themselves , '' is likely to be more obedient to it than one who believes it to be entirely subjective , having its seat in human consciousness only . But whatever a person 's opinion may be on this point of Ontology , the force he is really urged by is his own subjective feeling , and is exactly measured by its strength . No one's belief that Duty is an objective reality is stronger than the belief that God is so ; yet the belief in God , apart from the expectation of actual reward and punishment , only operates on conduct through , and in proportion to , the subjective religious feeling . The sanction , so far as it is disinterested , is always in the mind itself ; and the notion , therefore , of the transcendental moralists must be , that this sanction will not exist _in_ the mind unless it is believed to have its root out of the mind ; and that if a person is able to say to himself , That which is restraining me , and which is called my conscience , is only a feeling in my own mind , he may possibly draw the conclusion that when the feeling ceases the obligation ceases , and that if he find the feeling inconvenient , he may disregard it , and endeavour to get rid of it . But is this danger confined to the utilitarian morality ? Does the belief that moral obligation has its seat outside the mind make the feeling of it too strong to be got rid of ? The fact is so far otherwise , that all moralists admit and lament the ease with which , in the generality of minds , conscience can be silenced or stifled . The question , Need I obey my conscience ? is quite as often put to themselves by persons who never heard of the principle of utility , as by its adherents . Those whose conscientious feelings are so weak as to allow of their asking this question , if they answer it affirmatively , will not do so because they believe in the transcendental theory , but because of the external sanctions . It is not necessary , for the present purpose , to decide whether the feeling of duty is innate or implanted . Assuming it to be innate , it is an open question to what objects it naturally attaches itself ; for the philosophic supporters of that theory are now agreed that the intuitive perception is of principles of morality , and not of the details . If there be anything innate in the matter , I see no reason why the feeling which is innate should not be that of regard to the pleasures and pains of others . If there is any principle of morals which is intuitively obligatory , I should say it must be that . If so , the intuitive ethics would coincide with the utilitarian , and there would be no further quarrel between them . Even as it is , the intuitive moralists , though they believe that there are other intuitive moral obligations , do already believe this to be one ; for they unanimously hold that a large portion of morality turns upon the consideration due to the interests of our fellow creatures . Therefore , if the belief in the transcendental origin of moral obligation gives any additional efficacy to the internal sanction , it appears to me that the utilitarian principle has already the benefit of it . On the other hand , if , as is my own belief , the moral feelings are not innate , but acquired , they are not for that reason the less natural . It is natural to man to speak , to reason , to build cities , to cultivate the ground , though these are acquired faculties . The moral feelings are not indeed a part of our nature , in the sense of being in any perceptible degree present in all of us ; but this , unhappily , is a fact admitted by those who believe the most strenuously in their transcendental origin . Like the other acquired capacities above referred to , the moral faculty , if not a part of our nature , is a natural outgrowth from it ; capable , like them , in a certain small degree , of springing up spontaneously ; and susceptible of being brought by cultivation to a high degree of development . Unhappily it is also susceptible , by a sufficient use of the external sanctions and of the force of early impressions , of being cultivated in almost any direction : so that there is hardly anything so absurd or so mischievous that it may not , by means of these influences , be made to act on the human mind with all the authority of conscience . To doubt that the same potency might be given by the same means to the principle of utility , even if it had no foundation in human nature , would be flying in the face of all experience . But moral associations which are wholly of artificial creation , when intellectual culture goes on , yield by degrees to the dissolving force of analysis : and if the feeling of duty , when associated with utility , would appear equally arbitrary ; if there were no leading department of our nature , no powerful class of sentiments , with which that association would harmonize , which would make us feel it congenial , and incline us not only to foster it in others ( for which we have abundant interested motives ) , but also to cherish it in ourselves ; if there were not , in short , a natural basis of sentiment for utilitarian morality , it might well happen that this association also , even after it had been implanted by education , might be analysed away . But there is this basis of powerful natural sentiment ; and this it is which , when once the general happiness is recognized as the ethical standard , will constitute the strength of the utilitarian morality . This firm foundation is that of the social feelings of mankind ; the desire to be in unity with our fellow creatures , which is already a powerful principle in human nature , and happily one of those which tend to become stronger , even without express inculcation , from the influences of advancing civilization . The social state is at once so natural , so necessary , and so habitual to man , that , except in some unusual circumstances or by an effort of voluntary abstraction , he never conceives himself otherwise than as a member of a body ; and this association is riveted more and more , as mankind are further removed from the state of savage independence . Any condition , therefore , which is essential to a state of society , becomes more and more an inseparable part of every person 's conception of the state of things which he is born into , and which is the destiny of a human being . Now , society between human beings , except in the relation of master and slave , is manifestly impossible on any other footing than that the interests of all are to be consulted . Society between equals can only exist on the understanding that the interests of all are to be regarded equally . And since in all states of civilization , every person , except an absolute monarch , has equals , every one is obliged to live on these terms with somebody ; and in every age some advance is made towards a state in which it will be impossible to live permanently on other terms with anybody . In this way people grow up unable to conceive as possible to them a state of total disregard of other people 's interests . They are under a necessity of conceiving themselves as at least abstaining from all the grosser injuries , and ( if only for their own protection . ) living in a state of constant protest against them . They are also familiar with the fact of co-operating with others , and proposing to themselves a collective , not an individual , interest , as the aim ( at least for", "the time being ) of their actions . So long as they are co-operating , their ends are identified with those of others ; there is at least a temporary feeling that the interests of others are their own interests . Not only does all strengthening of social ties , and all healthy growth of society , give to each individual a stronger personal interest in practically consulting the welfare of others ; it also leads him to identify his feelings more and more with their good , or at least with an ever greater degree of practical consideration for it . He comes , as though instinctively , to be conscious of himself as a being who _of course_ pays regard to others . The good of others becomes to him a thing naturally and necessarily to be attended to , like any of the physical conditions of our existence . Now , whatever amount of this feeling a person has , he is urged by the strongest motives both of interest and of sympathy to demonstrate it , and to the utmost of his power encourage it in others ; and even if he has none of it himself , he is as greatly interested as any one else that others should have it . Consequently , the smallest germs of the feeling are laid hold of and nourished by the contagion of sympathy and the influences of education ; and a complete web of corroborative association is woven round it , by the powerful agency of the external sanctions . This mode of conceiving ourselves and human life , as civilization goes on , is felt to be more and more natural . Every step in political improvement renders it more so , by removing the sources of opposition of interest , and levelling those inequalities of legal privilege between individuals or classes , owing to which there are large portions of mankind whose happiness it is still practicable to disregard . In an improving state of the human mind , the influences are constantly on the increase , which tend to generate in each individual a feeling of unity with all the rest ; which feeling , if perfect , would make him never think of , or desire , any beneficial condition for himself , in the benefits of which they are not included . If we now suppose this feeling of unity to be taught as a religion , and the whole force of education , of institutions , and of opinion , directed , as it once was in the case of religion , to make every person grow up from infancy surrounded on all sides both by the profession and by the practice of it , I think that no one , who can realize this conception , will feel any misgiving about the sufficiency of the ultimate sanction for the Happiness morality . To any ethical student who finds the realization difficult , I recommend , as a means of facilitating it , the second of M. Comte 's two principal works , the _Systeme de Politique Positive_ . I entertain the strongest objections to the system of politics and morals set forth in that treatise ; but I think it has superabundantly shown the possibility of giving to the service of humanity , even without the aid of belief in a Providence , both the physical power and the social efficacy of a religion ; making it take hold of human life , and colour all thought , feeling , and action , in a manner of which the greatest ascendency ever exercised by any religion may be but a type and foretaste ; and of which the danger is , not that it should be insufficient , but that it should be so excessive as to interfere unduly with human freedom and individuality . Neither is it necessary to the feeling which constitutes the binding force of the utilitarian morality on those who recognize it , to wait for those social influences which would make its obligation felt by mankind at large . In the comparatively early state of human advancement in which we now live , a person can not indeed feel that entireness of sympathy with all others , which would make any real discordance in the general direction of their conduct in life impossible ; but already a person in whom the social feeling is at all developed , can not bring himself to think of the rest of his fellow creatures as struggling rivals with him for the means of happiness , whom he must desire to see defeated in their object in order that he may succeed in his . The deeply-rooted conception which every individual even now has of himself as a social being , tends to make him feel it one of his natural wants that there should be harmony between his feelings and aims and those of his fellow creatures . If differences of opinion and of mental culture make it impossible for him to share many of their actual feelings-perhaps make him denounce and defy those feelings-he still needs to be conscious that his real aim and theirs do not conflict ; that he is not opposing himself to what they really wish for , namely , their own good , but is , on the contrary , promoting it . This feeling in most individuals is much inferior in strength to their selfish feelings , and is often wanting altogether . But to those who have it , it possesses all the characters of a natural feeling . It does not present itself to their minds as a superstition of education , or a law despotically imposed by the power of society , but as an attribute which it would not be well for them to be without . This conviction is the ultimate sanction of the greatest-happiness morality . This it is which makes any mind , of well-developed feelings , work with , and not against , the outward motives to care for others , afforded by what I have called the external sanctions ; and when those sanctions are wanting , or act in an opposite direction , constitutes in itself a powerful internal binding force , in proportion to the sensitiveness and thoughtfulness of the character ; since few but those whose mind is a moral blank , could bear to lay out their course of life on the plan of paying no regard to others except so far as their own private interest compels . It has already been remarked , that questions of ultimate ends do not admit of proof , in the ordinary acceptation of the term . To be incapable of proof by reasoning is common to all first principles ; to the first premises of our knowledge , as well as to those of our conduct . But the former , being matters of fact , may be the subject of a direct appeal to the faculties which judge of fact -- namely , our senses , and our internal consciousness . Can an appeal be made to the same faculties on questions of practical ends ? Or by what other faculty is cognizance taken of them ? Questions about ends are , in other words , questions what things are desirable . The utilitarian doctrine is , that happiness is desirable , and the only thing desirable , as an end ; all other things being only desirable as means to that end . What ought to be required of this doctrine -- what conditions is it requisite that the doctrine should fulfil -- to make good its claim to be believed ? The only proof capable of being given that an object is visible , is that people actually see it . The only proof that a sound is audible , is that people hear it : and so of the other sources of our experience . In like manner , I apprehend , the sole evidence it is possible to produce that anything is desirable , is that people do actually desire it . If the end which the utilitarian doctrine proposes to itself were not , in theory and in practice , acknowledged to be an end , nothing could ever convince any person that it was so . No reason can be given why the general happiness is desirable , except that each person , so far as he believes it to be attainable , desires his own happiness . This , however , being a fact , we have not only all the proof which the case admits of , but all which it is possible to require , that happiness is a good : that each person 's happiness is a good to that person , and the general happiness , therefore , a good to the aggregate of all persons . Happiness has made out its title as _one_ of the ends of conduct , and consequently one of the criteria of morality . But it has not , by this alone , proved itself to be the sole criterion . To do that , it would seem , by the same rule , necessary to show , not only that people desire happiness , but that they never desire anything else . Now it is palpable that they do desire things which , in common language , are decidedly distinguished from happiness . They desire , for example , virtue , and the absence of vice , no less really than pleasure and the absence of pain . The desire of virtue is not as universal , but it is as authentic a fact , as the desire of happiness . And hence the opponents of the utilitarian standard deem that they have a right to infer that there are other ends of human action besides happiness , and that happiness is not the standard of approbation and disapprobation . But does the utilitarian doctrine deny that people desire virtue , or maintain that virtue is not a thing to be desired ? The very reverse . It maintains not only that virtue is to be desired , but that it is to be desired disinterestedly , for itself . Whatever may be the opinion of utilitarian moralists as to the original conditions by which virtue is made virtue ; however they may believe ( as they do ) that actions and dispositions are only virtuous because they promote another end than virtue ; yet this being granted , and it having been decided , from considerations of this description , what _is_ virtuous , they not only place virtue at the very head of the things which are good as means to the ultimate end , but they also recognise as a psychological fact the possibility of its being , to the individual , a good in itself , without looking to any end beyond it ; and hold , that the mind is not in a right state , not in a state conformable to Utility , not in the state most conducive to the general happiness , unless it does love virtue in this manner -- as a thing desirable in itself , even although , in the individual instance , it should not produce those other desirable consequences which it tends to produce , and on account of which it is held to be virtue . This opinion is not , in the smallest degree , a departure from the Happiness principle . The ingredients of happiness are very various , and each of them is desirable in itself , and not merely when considered as swelling an aggregate . The principle of utility does not mean that any given pleasure , as music , for instance , or any given exemption from pain , as for example health , are to be looked upon as means to a collective something termed happiness , and to be desired on that account . They are desired and desirable in and for themselves ; besides being means , they are a part of the end . Virtue , according to the utilitarian doctrine , is not naturally and originally part of the end , but it is capable of becoming so ; and in those who love it disinterestedly it has become so , and is desired and cherished , not as a means to happiness , but as a part of their happiness . To illustrate this farther , we may remember that virtue is not the only thing , originally a means , and which if it were not a means to anything else , would be and remain indifferent , but which by association with what it is a means to , comes to be desired for itself , and that too with the utmost intensity . What , for example , shall we say of the love of money ? There is nothing originally more desirable about money than about any heap of glittering pebbles . Its worth is solely that of the things which it will buy ; the desires for other things than itself , which it is a means of gratifying . Yet the love of money is not only one of the strongest moving forces of human life , but money is , in many cases , desired in and for itself ; the desire to possess it is often stronger than the desire to use it , and goes on increasing when all the desires which point to ends beyond it , to be compassed by it , are falling off . It may be then said truly , that money is desired not for the sake of an end , but as part of the end . From being a means to happiness , it has come to be itself a principal ingredient of the individual 's conception of happiness . The same may be said of the majority of the great objects of human life -- power , for example , or fame ; except that to each of these there is a certain amount of immediate pleasure annexed , which has at least the semblance of being naturally inherent in them ; a thing which can not be said of money . Still , however , the strongest natural attraction , both of power and of fame , is the immense aid they give to the attainment of our other wishes ; and it is the strong association thus generated between them and all our objects of desire , which gives to the direct desire of them the intensity it often assumes , so as in some characters to surpass in strength all other desires . In", "these cases the means have become a part of the end , and a more important part of it than any of the things which they are means to . What was once desired as an instrument for the attainment of happiness , has come to be desired for its own sake . In being desired for its own sake it is , however , desired as part of happiness . The person is made , or thinks he would be made , happy by its mere possession ; and is made unhappy by failure to obtain it . The desire of it is not a different thing from the desire of happiness , any more than the love of music , or the desire of health . They are included in happiness . They are some of the elements of which the desire of happiness is made up . Happiness is not an abstract idea , but a concrete whole ; and these are some of its parts . And the utilitarian standard sanctions and approves their being so . Life would be a poor thing , very ill provided with sources of happiness , if there were not this provision of nature , by which things originally indifferent , but conducive to , or otherwise associated with , the satisfaction of our primitive desires , become in themselves sources of pleasure more valuable than the primitive pleasures , both in permanency , in the space of human existence that they are capable of covering , and even in intensity . Virtue , according to the utilitarian conception , is a good of this description . There was no original desire of it , or motive to it , save its conduciveness to pleasure , and especially to protection from pain . But through the association thus formed , it may be felt a good in itself , and desired as such with as great intensity as any other good ; and with this difference between it and the love of money , of power , or of fame , that all of these may , and often do , render the individual noxious to the other members of the society to which he belongs , whereas there is nothing which makes him so much a blessing to them as the cultivation of the disinterested , love of virtue . And consequently , the utilitarian standard , while it tolerates and approves those other acquired desires , up to the point beyond which they would be more injurious to the general happiness than promotive of it , enjoins and requires the cultivation of the love of virtue up to the greatest strength possible , as being above all things important to the general happiness . It results from the preceding considerations , that there is in reality nothing desired except happiness . Whatever is desired otherwise than as a means to some end beyond itself , and ultimately to happiness , is desired as itself a part of happiness , and is not desired for itself until it has become so . Those who desire virtue for its own sake , desire it either because the consciousness of it is a pleasure , or because the consciousness of being without it is a pain , or for both reasons united ; as in truth the pleasure and pain seldom exist separately , but almost always together , the same person feeling pleasure in the degree of virtue attained , and pain in not having attained more . If one of these gave him no pleasure , and the other no pain , he would not love or desire virtue , or would desire it only for the other benefits which it might produce to himself or to persons whom he cared for . We have now , then , an answer to the question , of what sort of proof the principle of utility is susceptible . If the opinion which I have now stated is psychologically true -- if human nature is so constituted as to desire nothing which is not either a part of happiness or a means of happiness , we can have no other proof , and we require no other , that these are the only things desirable . If so , happiness is the sole end of human action , and the promotion of it the test by which to judge of all human conduct ; from whence it necessarily follows that it must be the criterion of morality , since a part is included in the whole . And now to decide whether this is really so ; whether mankind do desire nothing for itself but that which is a pleasure to them , or of which the absence is a pain ; we have evidently arrived at a question of fact and experience , dependent , like all similar questions , upon evidence . It can only be determined by practised self-consciousness and self-observation , assisted by observation of others . I believe that these sources of evidence , impartially consulted , will declare that desiring a thing and finding it pleasant , aversion to it and thinking of it as painful , are phenomena entirely inseparable , or rather two parts of the same phenomenon ; in strictness of language , two different modes of naming the same psychological fact : that to think of an object as desirable ( unless for the sake of its consequences ) , and to think of it as pleasant , are one and the same thing ; and that to desire anything , except in proportion as the idea of it is pleasant , is a physical and metaphysical impossibility . So obvious does this appear to me , that I expect it will hardly be disputed : and the objection made will be , not that desire can possibly be directed to anything ultimately except pleasure and exemption from pain , but that the will is a different thing from desire ; that a person of confirmed virtue , or any other person whose purposes are fixed , carries out his purposes without any thought of the pleasure he has in contemplating them , or expects to derive from their fulfilment ; and persists in acting on them , even though these pleasures are much diminished , by changes in his character or decay of his passive sensibilities , or are outweighed by the pains which the pursuit of the purposes may bring upon him . All this I fully admit , and have stated it elsewhere , as positively and emphatically as any one . Will , the active phenomenon , is a different thing from desire , the state of passive sensibility , and though originally an offshoot from it , may in time take root and detach itself from the parent stock ; so much so , that in the case of an habitual purpose , instead of willing the thing because we desire it , we often desire it only because we will it . This , however , is but an instance of that familiar fact , the power of habit , and is nowise confined to the case of virtuous actions . Many indifferent things , which men originally did from a motive of some sort , they continue to do from habit . Sometimes this is done unconsciously , the consciousness coming only after the action : at other times with conscious volition , but volition which has become habitual , and is put into operation by the force of habit , in opposition perhaps to the deliberate preference , as often happens with those who have contracted habits of vicious or hurtful indulgence . Third and last comes the case in which the habitual act of will in the individual instance is not in contradiction to the general intention prevailing at other times , but in fulfilment of it ; as in the case of the person of confirmed virtue , and of all who pursue deliberately and consistently any determinate end . The distinction between will and desire thus understood , is an authentic and highly important psychological fact ; but the fact consists solely in this -- that will , like all other parts of our constitution , is amenable to habit , and that we may will from habit what we no longer desire for itself , or desire only because we will it . It is not the less true that will , in the beginning , is entirely produced by desire ; including in that term the repelling influence of pain as well as the attractive one of pleasure . Let us take into consideration , no longer the person who has a confirmed will to do right , but him in whom that virtuous will is still feeble , conquerable by temptation , and not to be fully relied on ; by what means can it be strengthened ? How can the will to be virtuous , where it does not exist in sufficient force , be implanted or awakened ? Only by making the person _desire_ virtue -- by making him think of it in a pleasurable light , or of its absence in a painful one . It is by associating the doing right with pleasure , or the doing wrong with pain , or by eliciting and impressing and bringing home to the person's experience the pleasure naturally involved in the one or the pain in the other , that it is possible to call forth that will to be virtuous , which , when confirmed , acts without any thought of either pleasure or pain . Will is the child of desire , and passes out of the dominion of its parent only to come under that of habit . That which is the result of habit affords no presumption of being intrinsically good ; and there would be no reason for wishing that the purpose of virtue should become independent of pleasure and pain , were it not that the influence of the pleasurable and painful associations which prompt to virtue is not sufficiently to be depended on for unerring constancy of action until it has acquired the support of habit . Both in feeling and in conduct , habit is the only thing which imparts certainty ; and it is because of the importance to others of being able to rely absolutely on one 's feelings and conduct , and to oneself of being able to rely on one 's own , that the will to do right ought to be cultivated into this habitual independence . In other words , this state of the will is a means to good , not intrinsically a good ; and does not contradict the doctrine that nothing is a good to human beings but in so far as it is either itself pleasurable , or a means of attaining pleasure or averting pain . But if this doctrine be true , the principle of utility is proved . Whether it is so or not , must now be left to the consideration of the thoughtful reader . In all ages of speculation , one of the strongest obstacles to the reception of the doctrine that Utility or Happiness is the criterion of right and wrong , has been drawn from the idea of Justice , The powerful sentiment , and apparently clear perception , which that word recalls with a rapidity and certainty resembling an instinct , have seemed to the majority of thinkers to point to an inherent quality in things ; to show that the Just must have an existence in Nature as something absolute-generically distinct from every variety of the Expedient , and , in idea , opposed to it , though ( as is commonly acknowledged ) never , in the long run , disjoined from it in fact .", "In the case of this , as of our other moral sentiments , there is no necessary connexion between the question of its origin , and that of its binding force . That a feeling is bestowed on us by Nature , does not necessarily legitimate all its promptings . The feeling of justice might be a peculiar instinct , and might yet require , like our other instincts , to be controlled and enlightened by a higher reason . If we have intellectual instincts , leading us to judge in a particular way , as well as animal instincts that prompt us to act in a particular way , there is no necessity that the former should be more infallible in their sphere than the latter in theirs : it may as well happen that wrong judgments are occasionally suggested by those , as wrong actions by these . But though it is one thing to believe that we have natural feelings of justice , and another to acknowledge them as an ultimate criterion of conduct , these two opinions are very closely connected in point of fact . Mankind are always predisposed to believe that any subjective feeling , not otherwise accounted for , is a revelation of some objective reality . Our present object is to determine whether the reality , to which the feeling of justice corresponds , is one which needs any such special revelation ; whether the justice or injustice of an action is a thing intrinsically peculiar , and distinct from all its other qualities , or only a combination of certain of those qualities , presented under a peculiar aspect . For the purpose of this inquiry , it is practically important to consider whether the feeling itself , of justice and injustice , is _sui generis_ like our sensations of colour and taste , or a derivative feeling , formed by a combination of others . And this it is the more essential to examine , as people are in general willing enough to allow , that objectively the dictates of justice coincide with a part of the field of General Expediency ; but inasmuch as the subjective mental feeling of Justice is different from that which commonly attaches to simple expediency , and , except in extreme cases of the latter , is far more imperative in its demands , people find it difficult to see , in Justice , only a particular kind or branch of general utility , and think that its superior binding force requires a totally different origin . To throw light upon this question , it is necessary to attempt to ascertain what is the distinguishing character of justice , or of injustice : what is the quality , or whether there is any quality , attributed in common to all modes of conduct designated as unjust ( for justice , like many other moral attributes , is best defined by its opposite ) , and distinguishing them from such modes of conduct as are disapproved , but without having that particular epithet of disapprobation applied to them . If , in everything which men are accustomed to characterize as just or unjust , some one common attribute or collection of attributes is always present , we may judge whether this particular attribute or combination of attributes would be capable of gathering round it a sentiment of that peculiar character and intensity by virtue of the general laws of our emotional constitution , or whether the sentiment is inexplicable , and requires to be regarded as a special provision of Nature . If we find the former to be the case , we shall , in resolving this question , have resolved also the main problem : if the latter , we shall have to seek for some other mode of investigating it . * * * * * To find the common attributes of a variety of objects , it is necessary to begin , by surveying the objects themselves in the concrete . Let us therefore advert successively to the various modes of action , and arrangements of human affairs , which are classed , by universal or widely spread opinion , as Just or as Unjust . The things well known to excite the sentiments associated with those names , are of a very multifarious character . I shall pass them rapidly in review , without studying any particular arrangement . In the first place , it is mostly considered unjust to deprive any one of his personal liberty , his property , or any other thing which belongs to him by law . Here , therefore , is one instance of the application of the terms just and unjust in a perfectly definite sense , namely , that it is just to respect , unjust to violate , the _legal rights_ of any one . But this judgment admits of several exceptions , arising from the other forms in which the notions of justice and injustice present themselves . For example , the person who suffers the deprivation may ( as the phrase is ) have _forfeited_ the rights which he is so deprived of : a case to which we shall return presently . But also , Secondly ; the legal rights of which he is deprived , may be rights which _ought_ not to have belonged to him ; in other words , the law which confers on him these rights , may be a bad law . When it is so , or when ( which is the same thing for our purpose ) it is supposed to be so , opinions will differ as to the justice or injustice of infringing it . Some maintain that no law , however bad , ought to be disobeyed by an individual citizen ; that his opposition to it , if shown at all , should only be shown in endeavouring to get it altered by competent authority . This opinion ( which condemns many of the most illustrious benefactors of mankind , and would often protect pernicious institutions against the only weapons which , in the state of things existing at the time , have any chance of succeeding against them ) is defended , by those who hold it , on grounds of expediency ; principally on that of the importance , to the common interest of mankind , of maintaining inviolate the sentiment of submission to law . Other persons , again , hold the directly contrary opinion , that any law , judged to be bad , may blamelessly be disobeyed , even though it be not judged to be unjust , but only inexpedient ; while others would confine the licence of disobedience to the case of unjust laws : but again , some say , that all laws which are inexpedient are unjust ; since every law imposes some restriction on the natural liberty of mankind , which restriction is an injustice , unless legitimated by tending to their good . Among these diversities of opinion , it seems to be universally admitted that there may be unjust laws , and that law , consequently , is not the ultimate criterion of justice , but may give to one person a benefit , or impose on another an evil , which justice condemns . When , however , a law is thought to be unjust , it seems always to be regarded as being so in the same way in which a breach of law is unjust , namely , by infringing somebody 's right ; which , as it can not in this case be a legal right , receives a different appellation , and is called a moral right . We may say , therefore , that a second case of injustice consists in taking or withholding from any person that to which he has a _moral right_ . Thirdly , it is universally considered just that each person should obtain that ( whether good or evil ) which he _deserves_ ; and unjust that he should obtain a good , or be made to undergo an evil , which he does not deserve . This is , perhaps , the clearest and most emphatic form in which the idea of justice is conceived by the general mind . As it involves the notion of desert , the question arises , what constitutes desert ? Speaking in a general way , a person is understood to deserve good if he does right , evil if he does wrong ; and in a more particular sense , to deserve good from those to whom he does or has done good , and evil from those to whom he does or has done evil . The precept of returning good for evil has never been regarded as a case of the fulfilment of justice , but as one in which the claims of justice are waived , in obedience to other considerations . Fourthly , it is confessedly unjust to _break faith_ with any one : to violate an engagement , either express or implied , or disappoint expectations raised by our own conduct , at least if we have raised those expectations knowingly and voluntarily . Like the other obligations of justice already spoken of , this one is not regarded as absolute , but as capable of being overruled by a stronger obligation of justice on the other side ; or by such conduct on the part of the person concerned as is deemed to absolve us from our obligation to him , and to constitute a _forfeiture_ of the benefit which he has been led to expect . Fifthly , it is , by universal admission , inconsistent with justice to be _partial_ ; to show favour or preference to one person over another , in matters to which favour and preference do not properly apply . Impartiality , however , does not seem to be regarded as a duty in itself , but rather as instrumental to some other duty ; for it is admitted that favour and preference are not always censurable , and indeed the cases in which they are condemned are rather the exception than the rule . A person would be more likely to be blamed than applauded for giving his family or friends no superiority in good offices over strangers , when he could do so without violating any other duty ; and no one thinks it unjust to seek one person in preference to another as a friend , connexion , or companion . Impartiality where rights are concerned is of course obligatory , but this is involved in the more general obligation of giving to every one his right . A tribunal , for example , must be impartial , because it is bound to award , without regard to any other consideration , a disputed object to the one of two parties who has the right to it . There are other cases in which impartiality means , being solely influenced by desert ; as with those who , in the capacity of judges , preceptors , or parents , administer reward and punishment as such . There are cases , again , in which it means , being solely influenced by consideration for the public interest ; as in making a selection among candidates for a Government employment . Impartiality , in short , as an obligation of justice , may be said to mean , being exclusively influenced by the considerations which it is supposed ought to influence the particular case in hand ; and resisting the solicitation of any motives which prompt to conduct different from what those considerations would dictate . Nearly allied to the idea of impartiality , is that of _equality_ ; which often enters as a component part both into the conception of justice and into the practice of it , and , in the eyes of many persons , constitutes its essence . But in this , still more than in any other case , the notion of justice varies in different persons , and always conforms in its variations to their notion of utility . Each person maintains that equality is the dictate of justice , except where he thinks that expediency requires inequality . The justice of giving equal protection to the rights of all , is maintained by those who support the most outrageous inequality in the rights themselves . Even in slave countries it is theoretically admitted that the rights of the slave , such as they are , ought to be as sacred as those of the master ; and that a tribunal which fails to enforce them with equal strictness is wanting in justice ; while , at the same time , institutions which leave to the slave scarcely any rights to enforce , are not deemed unjust , because they are not deemed inexpedient . Those who think that utility requires distinctions of rank , do not consider it unjust that riches and social privileges should be unequally dispensed ; but those who think this inequality inexpedient , think it unjust also . Whoever thinks that government is necessary , sees no injustice in as much inequality as is constituted by giving to the magistrate powers not granted to other people . Even among those who hold levelling doctrines , there are as many questions of justice as there are differences of opinion about expediency . Some Communists consider it unjust that the produce of the labour of the community should be shared on any other principle than that of exact equality ; others think it just that those should receive most whose needs are greatest ; while others hold that those who work harder , or who produce more , or whose services are more valuable to the community , may justly claim a larger quota in the division of the produce . And the sense of natural justice may be plausibly appealed to in behalf of every one of these opinions . Among so many diverse applications of the term Justice , which yet is not regarded as ambiguous , it is a matter of some difficulty to seize the mental link which holds them together , and on which the moral sentiment adhering to the term essentially depends . Perhaps , in this embarrassment , some help may be derived from the history of the word , as indicated by its etymology . In most , if not in all languages , the etymology of the word which corresponds to Just , points to an origin connected either with positive law , or with that which was in most cases the primitive form of law-authoritative custom . _Justum_ is a form of _jussum_ ,", "that which has been ordered . _Jus_ is of the same origin . _Dichanou_ comes from _dichae_ , of which the principal meaning , at least in the historical ages of Greece , was a suit at law . Originally , indeed , it meant only the mode or _manner_ of doing things , but it early came to mean the _prescribed_ manner ; that which the recognized authorities , patriarchal , judicial , or political , would enforce . _Recht_ , from which came _right_ and _righteous_ , is synonymous with law . The original meaning , indeed , of _recht_ did not point to law , but to physical straightness ; as _wrong_ and its Latin equivalents meant twisted or tortuous ; and from this it is argued that right did not originally mean law , but on the contrary law meant right . But however this may be , the fact that _recht_ and _droit_ became restricted in their meaning to positive law , although much which is not required by law is equally necessary to moral straightness or rectitude , is as significant of the original character of moral ideas as if the derivation had been the reverse way . The courts of justice , the administration of justice , are the courts and the administration of law . _La justice_ , in French , is the established term for judicature . There can , I think , be no doubt that the _idee mere_ , the primitive element , in the formation of the notion of justice , was conformity to law . It constituted the entire idea among the Hebrews , up to the birth of Christianity ; as might be expected in the case of a people whose laws attempted to embrace all subjects on which precepts were required , and who believed those laws to be a direct emanation from the Supreme Being . But other nations , and in particular the Greeks and Romans , who knew that their laws had been made originally , and still continued to be made , by men , were not afraid to admit that those men might make bad laws ; might do , by law , the same things , and from the same motives , which , if done by individuals without the sanction of law , would be called unjust . And hence the sentiment of injustice came to be attached , not to all violations of law , but only to violations of such laws as _ought_ to exist , including such as ought to exist but do not ; and to laws themselves , if supposed to be contrary to what ought to be law . In this manner the idea of law and of its injunctions was still predominant in the notion of justice , even when the laws actually in force ceased to be accepted as the standard of it . It is true that mankind consider the idea of justice and its obligations as applicable to many things which neither are , nor is it desired that they should be , regulated by law . Nobody desires that laws should interfere with the whole detail of private life ; yet every one allows that in all daily conduct a person may and does show himself to be either just or unjust . But even here , the idea of the breach of what ought to be law , still lingers in a modified shape . It would always give us pleasure , and chime in with our feelings of fitness , that acts which we deem unjust should be punished , though we do not always think it expedient that this should be done by the tribunals . We forego that gratification on account of incidental inconveniences . We should be glad to see just conduct enforced and injustice repressed , even in the minutest details , if we were not , with reason , afraid of trusting the magistrate with so unlimited an amount of power over individuals . When we think that a person is bound in justice to do a thing , it is an ordinary form of language to say , that he ought to be compelled to do it . We should be gratified to see the obligation enforced by anybody who had the power . If we see that its enforcement by law would be inexpedient , we lament the impossibility , we consider the impunity given to injustice as an evil , and strive to make amends for it by bringing a strong expression of our own and the public disapprobation to bear upon the offender . Thus the idea of legal constraint is still the generating idea of the notion of justice , though undergoing several transformations before that notion , as it exists in an advanced state of society , becomes complete . The above is , I think , a true account , as far as it goes , of the origin and progressive growth of the idea of justice . But we must observe , that it contains , as yet , nothing to distinguish that obligation from moral obligation in general . For the truth is , that the idea of penal sanction , which is the essence of law , enters not only into the conception of injustice , but into that of any kind of wrong . We do not call anything wrong , unless we mean to imply that a person ought to be punished in some way or other for doing it ; if not by law , by the opinion of his fellow creatures ; if not by opinion , by the reproaches of his own conscience . This seems the real turning point of the distinction between morality and simple expediency . It is a part of the notion of Duty in every one of its forms , that a person may rightfully be compelled to fulfil it . Duty is a thing which may be _exacted_ from a person , as one exacts a debt . Unless we think that it might be exacted from him , we do not call it his duty . Reasons of prudence , or the interest of other people , may militate against actually exacting it ; but the person himself , it is clearly understood , would not be entitled to complain . There are other things , on the contrary , which we wish that people should do , which we like or admire them for doing , perhaps dislike or despise them for not doing , but yet admit that they are not bound to do ; it is not a case of moral obligation ; we do not blame them , that is , we do not think that they are proper objects of punishment . How we come by these ideas of deserving and not deserving punishment , will appear , perhaps , in the sequel ; but I think there is no doubt that this distinction lies at the bottom of the notions of right and wrong ; that we call any conduct wrong , or employ instead , some other term of dislike or disparagement , according as we think that the person ought , or ought not , to be punished for it ; and we say that it would be right to do so and so , or merely that it would be desirable or laudable , according as we would wish to see the person whom it concerns , compelled or only persuaded and exhorted , to act in that manner . [ C ] This , therefore , being the characteristic difference which marks off , not justice , but morality in general , from the remaining provinces of Expediency and Worthiness ; the character is still to be sought which distinguishes justice from other branches of morality . Now it is known that ethical writers divide moral duties into two classes , denoted by the ill-chosen expressions , duties of perfect and of imperfect obligation ; the latter being those in which , though the act is obligatory , the particular occasions of performing it are left to our choice ; as in the case of charity or beneficence , which we are indeed bound to practise , but not towards any definite person , nor at any prescribed time . In the more precise language of philosophic jurists , duties of perfect obligation are those duties in virtue of which a correlative right resides in some person or persons ; duties of imperfect obligation are those moral obligations which do not give birth to any right . I think it will be found that this distinction exactly coincides with that which exists between justice and the other obligations of morality . In our survey of the various popular acceptations of justice , the term appeared generally to involve the idea of a personal right -- a claim on the part of one or more individuals , like that which the law gives when it confers a proprietary or other legal right . Whether the injustice consists in depriving a person of a possession , or in breaking faith with him , or in treating him worse than he deserves , or worse than other people who have no greater claims , in each case the supposition implies two things -- a wrong done , and some assignable person who is wronged . Injustice may also be done by treating a person better than others ; but the wrong in this case is to his competitors , who are also assignable persons . It seems to me that this feature in the case -- a right in some person , correlative to the moral obligation -- constitutes the specific difference between justice , and generosity or beneficence . Justice implies something which it is not only right to do , and wrong not to do , but which some individual person can claim from us as his moral right . No one has a moral right to our generosity or beneficence , because we are not morally bound to practise those virtues towards any given individual . And it will be found , with respect to this as with respect to every correct definition , that the instances which seem to conflict with it are those which most confirm it . For if a moralist attempts , as some have done , to make out that mankind generally , though not any given individual , have a right to all the good we can do them , he at once , by that thesis , includes generosity and beneficence within the category of justice . He is obliged to say , that our utmost exertions are due to our fellow creatures , thus assimilating them to a debt ; or that nothing less can be a sufficient _return_ for what society does for us , thus classing the case as one of gratitude ; both of which are acknowledged cases of justice . Wherever there is a right , the case is one of justice , and not of the virtue of beneficence : and whoever does not place the distinction between justice and morality in general where we have now placed it , will be found to make no distinction between them at all , but to merge all morality in justice . Having thus endeavoured to determine the distinctive elements which enter into the composition of the idea of justice , we are ready to enter on the inquiry , whether the feeling , which accompanies the idea , is attached to it by a special dispensation of nature , or whether it could have grown up , by any known laws , out of the idea itself ; and in particular , whether it can have originated in considerations of general expediency . I conceive that the sentiment itself does not arise from anything which would commonly , or correctly , be termed an idea of expediency ; but that , though the sentiment does not , whatever is moral in it does . We have seen that the two essential ingredients in the sentiment of justice are , the desire to punish a person who has done harm , and the knowledge or belief that there is some definite individual or individuals to whom harm has been done . Now it appears to me , that the desire to punish a person who has done harm to some individual , is a spontaneous outgrowth from two sentiments , both in the highest degree natural , and which either are or resemble instincts ; the impulse of self-defence , and the feeling of sympathy . It is natural to resent , and to repel or retaliate , any harm done or attempted against ourselves , or against those with whom we sympathize . The origin of this sentiment it is not necessary here to discuss . Whether it be an instinct or a result of intelligence , it is , we know , common to all animal nature ; for every animal tries to hurt those who have hurt , or who it thinks are about to hurt , itself or its young . Human beings , on this point , only differ from other animals in two particulars . First , in being capable of sympathizing , not solely with their offspring , or , like some of the more noble animals , with some superior animal who is kind to them , but with all human , and even with all sentient beings . Secondly , in having a more developed intelligence , which gives a wider range to the whole of their sentiments , whether self-regarding or sympathetic . By virtue of his superior intelligence , even apart from his superior range of sympathy , a human being is capable of apprehending a community of interest between himself and the human society of which he forms a part , such that any conduct which threatens the security of the society generally , is threatening to his own , and calls forth his instinct ( if instinct it be ) of self-defence . The same superiority of intelligence , joined to the power of sympathizing with human beings generally , enables him to attach himself to the collective idea of his tribe , his country , or mankind , in such a manner that any act hurtful to them rouses his instinct of sympathy , and urges him to resistance . The sentiment of justice , in that one of its elements which consists of the desire to punish , is thus , I conceive , the natural feeling of retaliation or vengeance ,", "rendered by intellect and sympathy applicable to those injuries , that is , to those hurts , which wound us through , or in common with , society at large . This sentiment , in itself , has nothing moral in it ; what is moral is , the exclusive subordination of it to the social sympathies , so as to wait on and obey their call . For the natural feeling tends to make us resent indiscriminately whatever any one does that is disagreeable to us ; but when moralized by the social feeling , it only acts in the directions conformable to the general good ; just persons resenting a hurt to society , though not otherwise a hurt to themselves , and not resenting a hurt to themselves , however painful , unless it be of the kind which society has a common interest with them in the repression of . It is no objection against this doctrine to say , that when we feel our sentiment of justice outraged , we are not thinking of society at large , or of any collective interest , but only of the individual case . It is common enough certainly , though the reverse of commendable , to feel resentment merely because we have suffered pain ; but a person whose resentment is really a moral feeling , that is , who considers whether an act is blameable before he allows himself to resent it -- such a person , though he may not say expressly to himself that he is standing up for the interest of society , certainly does feel that he is asserting a rule which is for the benefit of others as well as for his own . If he is not feeling this -- if he is regarding the act solely as it affects him individually -- he is not consciously just ; he is not concerning himself about the justice of his actions . This is admitted even by anti-utilitarian moralists . When Kant ( as before remarked ) propounds as the fundamental principle of morals , 'So act , that thy rule of conduct might be adopted as a law by all rational beings , ' he virtually acknowledges that the interest of mankind collectively , or at least of mankind indiscriminately , must be in the mind of the agent when conscientiously deciding on the morality of the act . Otherwise he uses words without a meaning : for , that a rule even of utter selfishness could not _possibly_ be adopted by all rational beings -- that there is any insuperable obstacle in the nature of things to its adoption -- can not be even plausibly maintained . To give any meaning to Kant 's principle , the sense put upon it must be , that we ought to shape our conduct by a rule which all rational beings might adopt _with benefit to their collective interest_ . To recapitulate : the idea of justice supposes two things ; a rule of conduct , and a sentiment which sanctions the rule . The first must be supposed common to all mankind , and intended for their good . The other ( the sentiment ) is a desire that punishment may be suffered by those who infringe the rule . There is involved , in addition , the conception of some definite person who suffers by the infringement ; whose rights ( to use the expression appropriated to the case ) are violated by it . And the sentiment of justice appears to me to be , the animal desire to repel or retaliate a hurt or damage to oneself , or to those with whom one sympathizes , widened so as to include all persons , by the human capacity of enlarged sympathy , and the human conception of intelligent self-interest . From the latter elements , the feeling derives its morality ; from the former , its peculiar impressiveness , and energy of self-assertion . I have , throughout , treated the idea of a _right_ residing in the injured person , and violated by the injury , not as a separate element in the composition of the idea and sentiment , but as one of the forms in which the other two elements clothe themselves . These elements are , a hurt to some assignable person or persons on the one hand , and a demand for punishment on the other . An examination of our own minds , I think , will show , that these two things include all that we mean when we speak of violation of a right . When we call anything a person 's right , we mean that he has a valid claim on society to protect him in the possession of it , either by the force of law , or by that of education and opinion . If he has what we consider a sufficient claim , on whatever account , to have something guaranteed to him by society , we say that he has a right to it . If we desire to prove that anything does not belong to him by right , we think this done as soon as it is admitted that society ought not to take measures for securing it to him , but should leave it to chance , or to his own exertions . Thus , a person is said to have a right to what he can earn in fair professional competition ; because society ought not to allow any other person to hinder him from endeavouring to earn in that manner as much as he can . But he has not a right to three hundred a-year , though he may happen to be earning it ; because society is not called on to provide that he shall earn that sum . On the contrary , if he owns ten thousand pounds three per cent . stock , he _has_ a right to three hundred a-year ; because society has come under an obligation to provide him with an income of that amount . To have a right , then , is , I conceive , to have something which society ought to defend me in the possession of . If the objector goes on to ask why it ought , I can give him no other reason than general utility . If that expression does not seem to convey a sufficient feeling of the strength of the obligation , nor to account for the peculiar energy of the feeling , it is because there goes to the composition of the sentiment , not a rational only but also an animal element , the thirst for retaliation ; and this thirst derives its intensity , as well as its moral justification , from the extraordinarily important and impressive kind of utility which is concerned . The interest involved is that of security , to every one 's feelings the most vital of all interests . Nearly all other earthly benefits are needed by one person , not needed by another ; and many of them can , if necessary , be cheerfully foregone , or replaced by something else ; but security no human being can possibly do without ; on it we depend for all our immunity from evil , and for the whole value of all and every good , beyond the passing moment ; since nothing but the gratification of the instant could be of any worth to us , if we could be deprived of everything the next instant by whoever was momentarily stronger than ourselves . Now this most indispensable of all necessaries , after physical nutriment , can not be had , unless the machinery for providing it is kept unintermittedly in active play . Our notion , therefore , of the claim we have on our fellow creatures to join in making safe for us the very groundwork of our existence , gathers feelings round it so much more intense than those concerned in any of the more common cases of utility , that the difference in degree ( as is often the case in psychology ) becomes a real difference in kind . The claim assumes that character of absoluteness , that apparent infinity , and incommensurability with all other considerations , which constitute the distinction between the feeling of right and wrong and that of ordinary expediency and inexpediency . The feelings concerned are so powerful , and we count so positively on finding a responsive feeling in others ( all being alike interested ) , that _ought_ and _should_ grow into _must_ , and recognized indispensability becomes a moral necessity , analogous to physical , and often not inferior to it in binding force . If the preceding analysis , or something resembling it , be not the correct account of the notion of justice ; if justice be totally independent of utility , and be a standard _per se_ , which the mind can recognize by simple introspection of itself ; it is hard to understand why that internal oracle is so ambiguous , and why so many things appear either just or unjust , according to the light in which they are regarded . We are continually informed that Utility is an uncertain standard , which every different person interprets differently , and that there is no safety but in the immutable , ineffaceable , and unmistakeable dictates of Justice , which carry their evidence in themselves , and are independent of the fluctuations of opinion . One would suppose from this that on questions of justice there could be no controversy ; that if we take that for our rule , its application to any given case could leave us in as little doubt as a mathematical demonstration . So far is this from being the fact , that there is as much difference of opinion , and as fierce discussion , about what is just , as about what is useful to society . Not only have different nations and individuals different notions of justice , but , in the mind of one and the same individual , justice is not some one rule , principle , or maxim , but many , which do not always coincide in their dictates , and in choosing between which , he is guided either by some extraneous standard , or by his own personal predilections . For instance , there are some who say , that it is unjust to punish any one for the sake of example to others ; that punishment is just , only when intended for the good of the sufferer himself . Others maintain the extreme reverse , contending that to punish persons who have attained years of discretion , for their own benefit , is despotism and injustice , since if the matter at issue is solely their own good , no one has a right to control their own judgment of it ; but that they may justly be punished to prevent evil to others , this being an exercise of the legitimate right of self-defence . Mr. Owen , again , affirms that it is unjust to punish at all ; for the criminal did not make his own character ; his education , and the circumstances which surround him , have made him a criminal , and for these he is not responsible . All these opinions are extremely plausible ; and so long as the question is argued as one of justice simply , without going down to the principles which lie under justice and are the source of its authority , I am unable to see how any of these reasoners can be refuted . For , in truth , every one of the three builds upon rules of justice confessedly true . The first appeals to the acknowledged injustice of singling out an individual , and making him a sacrifice , without his consent , for other people 's benefit . The second relies on the acknowledged justice of self-defence , and the admitted injustice of forcing one person to conform to another 's notions of what constitutes his good . The Owenite invokes the admitted principle , that it is unjust to punish any one for what he can not help . Each is triumphant so long as he is not compelled to take into consideration any other maxims of justice than the one he has selected ; but as soon as their several maxims are brought face to face , each disputant seems to have exactly as much to say for himself as the others . No one of them can carry out his own notion of justice without trampling upon another equally binding . These are difficulties ; they have always been felt to be such ; and many devices have been invented to turn rather than to overcome them . As a refuge from the last of the three , men imagined what they called the freedom of the will ; fancying that they could not justify punishing a man whose will is in a thoroughly hateful state , unless it be supposed to have come into that state through no influence of anterior circumstances . To escape from the other difficulties , a favourite contrivance has been the fiction of a contract , whereby at some unknown period all the members of society engaged to obey the laws , and consented to be punished for any disobedience to them ; thereby giving to their legislators the right , which it is assumed they would not otherwise have had , of punishing them , either for their own good or for that of society . This happy thought was considered to get rid of the whole difficulty , and to legitimate the infliction of punishment , in virtue of another received maxim of justice , _volenti non fit injuria_ ; that is not unjust which is done with the consent of the person who is supposed to be hurt by it . I need hardly remark , that even if the consent were not a mere fiction , this maxim is not superior in authority to the others which it is brought in to supersede . It is , on the contrary , an instructive specimen of the loose and irregular manner in which supposed principles of justice grow up . This particular one evidently came into use as a help to the coarse exigencies of courts of law , which are sometimes obliged to be content with very uncertain presumptions , on account of the greater evils which would often arise from any attempt on their part to cut finer . But even courts of law are not able to adhere", "consistently to the maxim , for they allow voluntary engagements to be set aside on the ground of fraud , and sometimes on that of mere mistake or misinformation . Again , when the legitimacy of inflicting punishment is admitted , how many conflicting conceptions of justice come to light in discussing the proper apportionment of punishment to offences . No rule on this subject recommends itself so strongly to the primitive and spontaneous sentiment of justice , as the _lex talionis_ , an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth . Though this principle of the Jewish and of the Mahomedan law has been generally abandoned in Europe as a practical maxim , there is , I suspect , in most minds , a secret hankering after it ; and when retribution accidentally falls on an offender in that precise shape , the general feeling of satisfaction evinced , bears witness how natural is the sentiment to which this repayment in kind is acceptable . With many the test of justice in penal infliction is that the punishment should be proportioned to the offence ; meaning that it should be exactly measured by the moral guilt of the culprit ( whatever be their standard for measuring moral guilt ) : the consideration , what amount of punishment is necessary to deter from the offence , having nothing to do with the question of justice , in their estimation : while there are others to whom that consideration is all in all ; who maintain that it is not just , at least for man , to inflict on a fellow creature , whatever may be his offences , any amount of suffering beyond the least that will suffice to prevent him from repeating , and others from imitating , his misconduct . To take another example from a subject already once referred to . In a co-operative industrial association , is it just or not that talent or skill should give a title to superior remuneration ? On the negative side of the question it is argued , that whoever does the best he can , deserves equally well , and ought not in justice to be put in a position of inferiority for no fault of his own ; that superior abilities have already advantages more than enough , in the admiration they excite , the personal influence they command , and the internal sources of satisfaction attending them , without adding to these a superior share of the world 's goods ; and that society is bound in justice rather to make compensation to the less favoured , for this unmerited inequality of advantages , than to aggravate it . On the contrary side it is contended , that society receives more from the more efficient labourer ; that his services being more useful , society owes him a larger return for them ; that a greater share of the joint result is actually his work , and not to allow his claim to it is a kind of robbery ; that if he is only to receive as much as others , he can only be justly required to produce as much , and to give a smaller amount of time and exertion , proportioned to his superior efficiency . Who shall decide between these appeals to conflicting principles of justice ? Justice has in this case two sides to it , which it is impossible to bring into harmony , and the two disputants have chosen opposite sides ; the one looks to what it is just that the individual should receive , the other to what it is just that the community should give . Each , from his own point of view , is unanswerable ; and any choice between them , on grounds of justice , must be perfectly arbitrary . Social utility alone can decide the preference . How many , again , and how irreconcileable , are the standards of justice to which reference is made in discussing the repartition of taxation . One opinion is , that payment to the State should be in numerical proportion to pecuniary means . Others think that justice dictates what they term graduated taxation ; taking a higher percentage from those who have more to spare . In point of natural justice a strong case might be made for disregarding means altogether , and taking the same absolute sum ( whenever it could be got ) from every one : as the subscribers to a mess , or to a club , all pay the same sum for the same privileges , whether they can all equally afford it or not . Since the protection ( it might be said ) of law and government is afforded to , and is equally required by , all , there is no injustice in making all buy it at the same price . It is reckoned justice , not injustice , that a dealer should charge to all customers the same price for the same article , not a price varying according to their means of payment . This doctrine , as applied to taxation , finds no advocates , because it conflicts strongly with men's feelings of humanity and perceptions of social expediency ; but the principle of justice which it invokes is as true and as binding as those which can be appealed to against it . Accordingly , it exerts a tacit influence on the line of defence employed for other modes of assessing taxation . People feel obliged to argue that the State does more for the rich than for the poor , as a justification for its taking more from them : though this is in reality not true , for the rich would be far better able to protect themselves , in the absence of law or government , than the poor , and indeed would probably be successful in converting the poor into their slaves . Others , again , so far defer to the same conception of justice , as to maintain that all should pay an equal capitation tax for the protection of their persons ( these being of equal value to all ) , and an unequal tax for the protection of their property , which is unequal . To this others reply , that the all of one man is as valuable to him as the all of another . From these confusions there is no other mode of extrication than the utilitarian . * * * * * Is , then , the difference between the Just and the Expedient a merely imaginary distinction ? Have mankind been under a delusion in thinking that justice is a more sacred thing than policy , and that the latter ought only to be listened to after the former has been satisfied ? By no means . The exposition we have given of the nature and origin of the sentiment , recognises a real distinction ; and no one of those who profess the most sublime contempt for the consequences of actions as an element in their morality , attaches more importance to the distinction than I do . While I dispute the pretensions of any theory which sets up an imaginary standard of justice not grounded on utility , I account the justice which is grounded on utility to be the chief part , and incomparably the most sacred and binding part , of all morality . Justice is a name for certain classes of moral rules , which concern the essentials of human well-being more nearly , and are therefore of more absolute obligation , than any other rules for the guidance of life ; and the notion which we have found to be of the essence of the idea of justice , that of a right residing in an individual , implies and testifies to this more binding obligation . The moral rules which forbid mankind to hurt one another ( in which we must never forget to include wrongful interference with each other's freedom ) are more vital to human well-being than any maxims , however important , which only point out the best mode of managing some department of human affairs . They have also the peculiarity , that they are the main element in determining the whole of the social feelings of mankind . It is their observance which alone preserves peace among human beings : if obedience to them were not the rule , and disobedience the exception , every one would see in every one else a probable enemy , against whom he must be perpetually guarding himself . What is hardly less important , these are the precepts which mankind have the strongest and the most direct inducements for impressing upon one another . By merely giving to each other prudential instruction or exhortation , they may gain , or think they gain , nothing : in inculcating on each other the duty of positive beneficence they have an unmistakeable interest , but far less in degree : a person may possibly not need the benefits of others ; but he always needs that they should not do him hurt . Thus the moralities which protect every individual from being harmed by others , either directly or by being hindered in his freedom of pursuing his own good , are at once those which he himself has most at heart , and those which he has the strongest interest in publishing and enforcing by word and deed . It is by a person 's observance of these , that his fitness to exist as one of the fellowship of human beings , is tested and decided ; for on that depends his being a nuisance or not to those with whom he is in contact . Now it is these moralities primarily , which compose the obligations of justice . The most marked cases of injustice , and those which give the tone to the feeling of repugnance which characterizes the sentiment , are acts of wrongful aggression , or wrongful exercise of power over some one ; the next are those which consist in wrongfully withholding from him something which is his due ; in both cases , inflicting on him a positive hurt , either in the form of direct suffering , or of the privation of some good which he had reasonable ground , either of a physical or of a social kind , for counting upon . The same powerful motives which command the observance of these primary moralities , enjoin the punishment of those who violate them ; and as the impulses of self-defence , of defence of others , and of vengeance , are all called forth against such persons , retribution , or evil for evil , becomes closely connected with the sentiment of justice , and is universally included in the idea . Good for good is also one of the dictates of justice ; and this , though its social utility is evident , and though it carries with it a natural human feeling , has not at first sight that obvious connexion with hurt or injury , which , existing in the most elementary cases of just and unjust , is the source of the characteristic intensity of the sentiment . But the connexion , though less obvious , is not less real . He who accepts benefits , and denies a return of them when needed , inflicts a real hurt , by disappointing one of the most natural and reasonable of expectations , and one which he must at least tacitly have encouraged , otherwise the benefits would seldom have been conferred . The important rank , among human evils and wrongs , of the disappointment of expectation , is shown in the fact that it constitutes the principal criminality of two such highly immoral acts as a breach of friendship and a breach of promise . Few hurts which human beings can sustain are greater , and none wound more , than when that on which they habitually and with full assurance relied , fails them in the hour of need ; and few wrongs are greater than this mere withholding of good ; none excite more resentment , either in the person suffering , or in a sympathizing spectator . The principle , therefore , of giving to each what they deserve , that is , good for good as well as evil for evil , is not only included within the idea of Justice as we have defined it , but is a proper object of that intensity of sentiment , which places the Just , in human estimation , above the simply Expedient . Most of the maxims of justice current in the world , and commonly appealed to in its transactions , are simply instrumental to carrying into effect the principles of justice which we have now spoken of . That a person is only responsible for what he has done voluntarily , or could voluntarily have avoided ; that it is unjust to condemn any person unheard ; that the punishment ought to be proportioned to the offence , and the like , are maxims intended to prevent the just principle of evil for evil from being perverted to the infliction of evil without that justification . The greater part of these common maxims have come into use from the practice of courts of justice , which have been naturally led to a more complete recognition and elaboration than was likely to suggest itself to others , of the rules necessary to enable them to fulfil their double function , of inflicting punishment when due , and of awarding to each person his right . That first of judicial virtues , impartiality , is an obligation of justice , partly for the reason last mentioned ; as being a necessary condition of the fulfilment of the other obligations of justice . But this is not the only source of the exalted rank , among human obligations , of those maxims of equality and impartiality , which , both in popular estimation and in that of the most enlightened , are included among the precepts of justice . In one point of view , they may be considered as corollaries from the principles already laid down . If it is a duty to do to each according to his deserts , returning good for good as well as repressing evil by evil , it necessarily follows that we should treat all equally well ( when no higher duty forbids ) who have deserved equally well of us , and that society should treat all equally well who have deserved equally well of it , that is ,", "who have deserved equally well absolutely . This is the highest abstract standard of social and distributive justice ; towards which all institutions , and the efforts of all virtuous citizens , should be made in the utmost possible degree to converge . But this great moral duty rests upon a still deeper foundation , being a direct emanation from the first principle of morals , and not a mere logical corollary from secondary or derivative doctrines . It is involved in the very meaning of Utility , or the Greatest-Happiness Principle . That principle is a mere form of words without rational signification , unless one person 's happiness , supposed equal in degree ( with the proper allowance made for kind ) , is counted for exactly as much as another 's . Those conditions being supplied , Bentham 's dictum , 'everybody to count for one , nobody for more than one , ' might be written under the principle of utility as an explanatory commentary . [ D ] The equal claim of everybody to happiness in the estimation of the moralist and the legislator , involves an equal claim to all the means of happiness , except in so far as the inevitable conditions of human life , and the general interest , in which that of every individual is included , set limits to the maxim ; and those limits ought to be strictly construed . As every other maxim of justice , so this , is by no means applied or held applicable universally ; on the contrary , as I have already remarked , it bends to every person 's ideas of social expediency . But in whatever case it is deemed applicable at all , it is held to be the dictate of justice . All persons are deemed to have a _right_ to equality of treatment , except when some recognised social expediency requires the reverse . And hence all social inequalities which have ceased to be considered expedient , assume the character not of simple inexpediency , but of injustice , and appear so tyrannical , that people are apt to wonder how they ever could have been tolerated ; forgetful that they themselves perhaps tolerate other inequalities under an equally mistaken notion of expediency , the correction of which would make that which they approve seem quite as monstrous as what they have at last learnt to condemn . The entire history of social improvement has been a series of transitions , by which one custom or institution after another , from being a supposed primary necessity of social existence , has passed into the rank of an universally stigmatized injustice and tyranny . So it has been with the distinctions of slaves and freemen , nobles and serfs , patricians and plebeians ; and so it will be , and in part already is , with the aristocracies of colour , race , and sex . It appears from what has been said , that justice is a name for certain moral requirements , which , regarded collectively , stand higher in the scale of social utility , and are therefore of more paramount obligation , than any others ; though particular cases may occur in which some other social duty is so important , as to overrule any one of the general maxims of justice . Thus , to save a life , it may not only be allowable , but a duty , to steal , or take by force , the necessary food or medicine , or to kidnap , and compel to officiate , the only qualified medical practitioner . In such cases , as we do not call anything justice which is not a virtue , we usually say , not that justice must give way to some other moral principle , but that what is just in ordinary cases is , by reason of that other principle , not just in the particular case . By this useful accommodation of language , the character of indefeasibility attributed to justice is kept up , and we are saved from the necessity of maintaining that there can be laudable injustice . The considerations which have now been adduced resolve , I conceive , the only real difficulty in the utilitarian theory of morals . It has always been evident that all cases of justice are also cases of expediency : the difference is in the peculiar sentiment which attaches to the former , as contradistinguished from the latter . If this characteristic sentiment has been sufficiently accounted for ; if there is no necessity to assume for it any peculiarity of origin ; if it is simply the natural feeling of resentment , moralized by being made coextensive with the demands of social good ; and if this feeling not only does but ought to exist in all the classes of cases to which the idea of justice corresponds ; that idea no longer presents itself as a stumbling-block to the utilitarian ethics . Justice remains the appropriate name for certain social utilities which are vastly more important , and therefore more absolute and imperative , than any others are as a class ( though not more so than others may be in particular cases ) ; and which , therefore , ought to be , as well as naturally are , guarded by a sentiment not only different in degree , but also in kind ; distinguished from the milder feeling which attaches to the mere idea of promoting human pleasure or convenience , at once by the more definite nature of its commands , and by the sterner character of its sanctions ."], "summaries": ["In the midst of human knowledge, the lack of progress in defining the criterion of right and wrong reveals a stagnant state of speculation on vital matters.", "The text discusses the longstanding philosophical debate on morality and the concept of the \"summum bonum,\" focusing on the idea that actions are deemed right when they promote happiness and wrong when they lead to unhappiness.

On a high terrace of the roof stands a_ WATCHMAN. _It is night_. WATCHMAN. This waste of year-long vigil I have prayed\n God for some respite, watching elbow-stayed,\n     As sleuthhounds watch, above the Atreidae's hall,\n     Till well I know yon midnight festival\n     Of swarming stars, and them that lonely go,\n     Bearers to man of summer and of snow,\n     Great lords and shining, throned in heavenly fire. And still I await the sign, the beacon pyre\n     That bears Troy's capture on a voice of flame\n     Shouting o'erseas. So surely to her aim\n     Cleaveth a woman's heart, man-passioned! And when I turn me to my bed--my bed\n     Dew-drenched and dark and stumbling, to which near\n     Cometh no dream nor sleep, but alway Fear\n     Breathes round it, warning, lest an eye once fain\n     To close may close too well to wake again;\n     Think I perchance to sing or troll a tune\n     For medicine against sleep, the music soon\n     Changes to sighing for the tale untold\n     Of this house, not well mastered as of old. Howbeit, may God yet send us rest, and light\n     The flame of good news flashed across the night. [_He is silent, watching. Suddenly at a distance in the night there is\n     a glimmer of fire, increasing presently to a blaze._\n \n     Ha! 0 kindler of the dark, O daylight birth\n     Of dawn and dancing upon Argive earth\n     For this great end! All hail!--What ho, within! What ho! Bear word to Agamemnon's queen\n     To rise, like dawn, and lift in answer strong\n     To this glad lamp her women's triumph-song,\n     If verily, verily, Ilion's citadel\n     Is fallen, as yon beacons flaming tell. And I myself will tread the dance before\n     All others; for my master's dice I score\n     Good, and mine own to-night three sixes plain. [_Lights begin to show in the Palace_. Oh, good or ill, my hand shall clasp again\n     My dear lord's hand, returning! Beyond that\n     I speak not. A great ox hath laid his weight\n     Across my tongue. But these stone walls know well,\n     If stones had speech, what tale were theirs to tell. For me, to him that knoweth I can yet\n     Speak; if another questions I forget. [_Exit into the Palace. The women's \"Ololuge\" or triumph-cry, is heard\n     within and then repeated again and again further off in the City. Handmaids and Attendants come from the Palace, bearing torches, with which\n     they kindle incense on the altars. Among them comes_ CLYTEMNESTRA, _who\n     throws herself on her knees at the central Altar in an agony of prayer._\n \n     _Presently from the further side of the open space appear the_ CHORUS _of_\n     ELDERS _and move gradually into position in front of the Palace. The day begins to dawn._\n \n     CHORUS. Ten years since Ilion's righteous foes,\n     The Atreidae strong,\n     Menelaues and eke Agamemnon arose,\n     Two thrones, two sceptres, yoked of God;\n And a thousand galleys of Argos trod\n The seas for the righting of wrong;\n And wrath of battle about them cried,\n     As vultures cry,\n     Whose nest is plundered, and up they fly\n     In anguish lonely, eddying wide,\n     Great wings like oars in the waste of sky,\n     Their task gone from them, no more to keep\n     Watch o'er the vulture babes asleep. But One there is who heareth on high\n     Some Pan or Zeus, some lost Apollo--\n     That keen bird-throated suffering cry\n     Of the stranger wronged in God's own sky;\n     And sendeth down, for the law transgressed,\n     The Wrath of the Feet that follow. So Zeus the Watcher of Friend and Friend,\n     Zeus who Prevaileth, in after quest\n     For One Beloved by Many Men\n     On Paris sent the Atreidae twain;\n     Yea, sent him dances before the end\n     For his bridal cheer,\n     Wrestlings heavy and limbs forespent\n     For Greek and Trojan, the knee earth-bent,\n     The bloody dust and the broken spear. He knoweth, that which is here is here,\n     And that which Shall Be followeth near;\n He seeketh God with a great desire,\n    He heaps his gifts, he essays his pyre\n    With torch below and with oil above,\n    With tears, but never the wrath shall move\n    Of the Altar cold that rejects his fire. We saw the Avengers go that day,\n    And they left us here; for our flesh is old\n    And serveth not; and these staves uphold\n    A strength like the strength of a child at play. For the sap that springs in the young man's hand\n    And the valour of age, they have left the land. And the passing old, while the dead leaf blows\n    And the old staff gropeth his three-foot way,\n    Weak as a babe and alone he goes,\n    A dream left wandering in the day. [_Coming near the Central Altar they see_ CLYTEMNESTRA, _who is still\n    rapt in prayer_.", "But thou, O daughter of Tyndareus,\n    Queen Clytemnestra, what need? What news? What tale or tiding hath stirred thy mood\n    To send forth word upon all our ways\n    For incensed worship? Of every god\n    That guards the city, the deep, the high,\n    Gods of the mart, gods of the sky,\n    The altars blaze. One here, one there,\n    To the skyey night the firebrands flare,\n    Drunk with the soft and guileless spell\n    Of balm of kings from the inmost cell. Tell, O Queen, and reject us not,\n    All that can or that may be told,\n    And healer be to this aching thought,\n    Which one time hovereth, evil-cold,\n    And then from the fires thou kindlest\n    Will Hope be kindled, and hungry Care\n    Fall back for a little while, nor tear\n    The heart that beateth below my breast. [CLYTEMNESTRA _rises silently, as though unconscious of their presence,\n    and goes into the House. The_ CHORUS _take position and begin their first\n    Stasimon, or Standing-song,_\n \n    CHORUS. (_The sign seen on the way; Eagles tearing a hare with young_.) It is ours to tell of the Sign of the War-way given,\n    To men more strong,\n    (For a life that is kin unto ours yet breathes from heaven\n     A spell, a Strength of Song:)\n    How the twin-throned Might of Achaia, one Crown divided\n    Above all Greeks that are,\n    With avenging hand and spear upon Troy was guided\n    By the Bird of War. 'Twas a King among birds to each of the Kings of the Sea,\n    One Eagle black, one black but of fire-white tail,\n    By the House, on the Spear-hand, in station that all might see;\n And they tore a hare, and the life in her womb that grew,\n     Yea, the life unlived and the races unrun they slew. _Sorrow, sing sorrow: but good prevail, prevail_! (_How Calchas read the sign; his Vision of the Future_.) And the War-seer wise, as he looked on the Atreid Yoke\n     Twain-tempered, knew\n     Those fierce hare-renders the lords of his host; and spoke,\n     Reading the omen true. \"At the last, the last, this Hunt hunteth Ilion down,\n     Yea, and before the wall\n     Violent division the fulness of land and town\n     Shall waste withal;\n     If only God's eye gloom not against our gates,\n     And the great War-curb of Troy, fore-smitten, fail. For Pity lives, and those winged Hounds she hates,\n     Which tore in the Trembler's body the unborn beast. And Artemis abhorreth the eagles' feast.\" _Sorrow, sing sorrow: but good prevail, prevail_! (_He prays to Artemis to grant the fulfilment of the Sign, but, as his\n      vision increases, he is afraid and calls on Paian, the Healer, to hold her\n      back_.) \"Thou beautiful One, thou tender lover\n     Of the dewy breath of the Lion's child;\n     Thou the delight, through den and cover,\n     Of the young life at the breast of the wild,\n     Yet, oh, fulfill, fulfill The sign of the Eagles' Kill! Be the vision accepted, albeit horrible.... But I-e, I-e! Stay her, O Paian, stay! For lo, upon other evil her heart she setteth,\n     Long wastes of wind, held ship and unventured sea,\n     On, on, till another Shedding of Blood be wrought:\n     They kill but feast not; they pray not; the law is broken;\n     Strife in the flesh, and the bride she obeyeth not,\n     And beyond, beyond, there abideth in wrath reawoken--\n     It plotteth, it haunteth the house, yea, it never forgetteth--\n     Wrath for a child to be.\" So Calchas, reading the wayside eagles' sign,\n     Spake to the Kings, blessings and words of bale;\n And like his song be thine,\n     _Sorrow, sing sorrow: but good prevail, prevail_! (_Such religion belongs to old and barbarous gods, and brings no peace. I turn to Zeus, who has shown man how to Learn by Suffering_.) Zeus! Zeus, whate'er He be,\n     If this name He love to hear\n     This He shall be called of me. Searching earth and sea and air\n \n     Refuge nowhere can I find\n     Save Him only, if my mind\n     Will cast off before it die\n     The burden of this vanity. One there was who reigned of old,\n     Big with wrath to brave and blast,\n     Lo, his name is no more told! And who followed met at last\n     His Third-thrower, and is gone. Only they whose hearts have known\n     Zeus, the Conqueror and the Friend,\n     They shall win their vision's end;\n \n Zeus the Guide, who made man turn\n Thought-ward, Zeus, who did ordain\n Man by Suffering shall Learn. So the heart of him, again\n Aching with remembered pain,\n        Bleeds and sleepeth not, until\n        Wisdom comes against his will. 'Tis the gift of One by strife\n        Lifted to the throne of life. (AGAMEMNON _accepted the sign. Then came long delay, and storm while the\n         fleet lay at Aulis._)\n \n        So that day the Elder Lord,\n        Marshal of the Achaian ships,\n        Strove not with the prophet's word,\n        Bowed him to his fate's eclipse,\n        When with empty jars and lips\n        Parched and seas impassable\n        Fate on that Greek army fell,\n        Fronting Chalcis as it lay,\n        By Aulis in the swirling bay. (_Till at last Calchas answered that Artemis was wroth and demanded the\n         death of_ AGAMEMNON'S _daughter. The King's doubt and grief_.) And winds, winds blew from Strymon River,\n        Unharboured, starving, winds of waste endeavour,\n        Man-blinding, pitiless to cord and bulwark,\n        And the waste of days was made long, more long,\n        Till the flower of Argos was aghast and withered;\n Then through the storm rose the War-seer's song,\n      And told of medicine that should tame the tempest,\n      But bow the Princes to a direr wrong. Then \"Artemis\" he whispered, he named the name;\n      And the brother Kings they shook in the hearts of them,\n      And smote on the earth their staves, and the tears came. But the King, the elder, hath found voice and spoken:\n      \"A heavy doom, sure, if God's will were broken;\n      But to slay mine own child, who my house delighteth,\n      Is that not heavy? That her blood should flow\n      On her father's hand, hard beside an altar? My path is sorrow wheresoe'er I go. Shall Agamemnon fail his ships and people,\n      And the hosts of Hellas melt as melts the snow? They cry, they thirst, for a death that shall break the spell,\n      For a Virgin's blood: 'tis a rite of old, men tell. And they burn with longing.--O God may the end be well!\" (_But ambition drove him, till he consented to the sin of slaying his\n       daughter, Iphigenia, as a sacrifice._)\n \n      To the yoke of Must-Be he bowed him slowly,\n      And a strange wind within his bosom tossed,\n      A wind of dark thought, unclean, unholy;\n And he rose up, daring to the uttermost. For men are boldened by a Blindness, straying\n Toward base desire, which brings grief hereafter,\n        Yea, and itself is grief;\n So this man hardened to his own child's slaying,\n    As help to avenge him for a woman's laughter\n    And bring his ships relief! Her \"Father, Father,\" her sad cry that lingered,\n    Her virgin heart's breath they held all as naught,\n    Those bronze-clad witnesses and battle-hungered;\n And there they prayed, and when the prayer was wrought\n He charged the young men to uplift and bind her,\n    As ye lift a wild kid, high above the altar,\n    Fierce-huddling forward, fallen, clinging sore\n    To the robe that wrapt her; yea, he bids them hinder\n    The sweet mouth's utterance, the cries that falter,\n    --His curse for evermore!--\n \n    With violence and a curb's voiceless wrath. Her stole of saffron then to the ground she threw,\n    And her eye with an arrow of pity found its path\n    To each man's heart that slew:\n    A face in a picture, striving amazedly;\n    The little maid who danced at her father's board,\n    The innocent voice man's love came never nigh,\n    Who joined to his her little paean-cry\n    When the third cup was poured....\n \n    What came thereafter I saw not neither tell. But the craft of Calchas failed not.--'Tis written, He\n    Who Suffereth Shall Learn; the law holdeth well. And that which is to be,\n    Ye will know at last; why weep before the hour? For come it shall, as out of darkness dawn. Only may good from all this evil flower;\n    So prays this Heart of Argos, this frail tower\n    Guarding the land alone. [_As they cease,_ CLYTEMNESTRA _comes from the Palace with Attendants.", "She has finished her prayer and sacrifice, and is now wrought up to face\n    the meeting with her husband. The Leader approaches her_. LEADER. Before thy state, O Queen, I bow mine eyes. 'Tis written, when the man's throne empty lies,\n    The woman shall be honoured.--Hast thou heard\n    Some tiding sure? Or is it Hope, hath stirred\n    To fire these altars? Dearly though we seek\n    To learn, 'tis thine to speak or not to speak. CLYTEMNESTRA. Glad-voiced, the old saw telleth, comes this morn,\n    The Star-child of a dancing midnight born,\n    And beareth to thine ear a word of joy\n    Beyond all hope: the Greek hath taken Troy. LEADER. How? Thy word flies past me, being incredible. CLYTEMNESTRA. Ilion is ours. No riddling tale I tell. LEADER. Such joy comes knocking at the gate of tears. CLYTEMNESTRA. Aye, 'tis a faithful heart that eye declares. LEADER. What warrant hast thou? Is there proof of this? CLYTEMNESTRA. There is; unless a God hath lied there is. LEADER. Some dream-shape came to thee in speaking guise? CLYTEMNESTRA. Who deemeth me a dupe of drowsing eyes? LEADER. Some word within that hovereth without wings? CLYTEMNESTRA. Am I a child to hearken to such things? LEADER. Troy fallen?--But how long? When fell she, say? CLYTEMNESTRA. The very night that mothered this new day. LEADER. And who of heralds with such fury came? CLYTEMNESTRA. A Fire-god, from Mount Ida scattering flame. Whence starting, beacon after beacon burst\n    In flaming message hitherward. Ida first\n    Told Hermes' Lemnian Rock, whose answering sign\n    Was caught by towering Athos, the divine,\n    With pines immense--yea, fishes of the night\n    Swam skyward, drunken with that leaping light,\n    Which swelled like some strange sun, till dim and far\n    Makistos' watchmen marked a glimmering star;\n    They, nowise loath nor idly slumber-won,\n    Spring up to hurl the fiery message on,\n    And a far light beyond the Euripus tells\n    That word hath reached Messapion's sentinels. They beaconed back, then onward with a high\n    Heap of dead heather flaming to the sky. And onward still, not failing nor aswoon,\n    Across the Asopus like a beaming moon\n    The great word leapt, and on Kithairon's height\n    Uproused a new relay of racing light. His watchers knew the wandering flame, nor hid\n    Their welcome, burning higher than was bid. Out over Lake Gorgopis then it floats,\n    To Aigiplanctos, waking the wild goats,\n    Crying for \"Fire, more Fire!\" And fire was reared,\n    Stintless and high, a stormy streaming beard,\n    That waved in flame beyond the promontory\n    Rock-ridged, that watches the Saronian sea,\n    Kindling the night: then one short swoop to catch\n    The Spider's Crag, our city's tower of watch;\n    Whence hither to the Atreidae's roof it came,\n    A light true-fathered of Idaean flame. Torch-bearer after torch-bearer, behold\n    The tale thereof in stations manifold,\n    Each one by each made perfect ere it passed,\n    And Victory in the first as in the last. These be my proofs and tokens that my lord\n    From Troy hath spoke to me a burning word. LEADER. Woman, speak on. Hereafter shall my prayer\n    Be raised to God; now let me only hear,\n    Again and full, the marvel and the joy. CLYTEMNESTRA. Now, even now, the Achaian holdeth Troy! Methinks there is a crying in her streets\n    That makes no concord. When sweet unguent meets\n    With vinegar in one phial, I warrant none\n    Shall lay those wranglers lovingly at one. So conquerors and conquered shalt thou hear,\n    Two sundered tones, two lives of joy or fear. Here women in the dust about their slain,\n    Husbands or brethren, and by dead old men\n    Pale children who shall never more be free,\n    For all they loved on earth cry desolately. And hard beside them war-stained Greeks, whom stark\n    Battle and then long searching through the dark\n    Hath gathered, ravenous, in the dawn, to feast\n    At last on all the plenty Troy possessed,\n    No portion in that feast nor ordinance,\n    But each man clutching at the prize of chance. Aye, there at last under good roofs they lie\n    Of men spear-quelled, no frosts beneath the sky,\n    No watches more, no bitter moony dew....\n    How blessed they will sleep the whole night through! Oh, if these days they keep them free from sin\n    Toward Ilion's conquered shrines and Them within\n    Who watch unconquered, maybe not again\n    The smiter shall be smit, the taker ta'en. May God but grant there fall not on that host\n    The greed of gold that maddeneth and the lust\n    To spoil inviolate things! But half the race\n    Is run which windeth back to home and peace. Yea, though of God they pass unchallenged,\n    Methinks the wound of all those desolate dead\n    Might waken, groping for its will....\n    Ye hear\n    A woman's word, belike a woman's fear. May good but conquer in the last incline\n    Of the balance! Of all prayers that prayer is mine. LEADER. O Woman, like a man faithful and wise\n    Thou speakest. I accept thy testimonies\n    And turn to God with praising, for a gain\n    Is won this day that pays for all our pain. [CLYTEMNESTRA _returns to the Palace. The_ CHORUS _take up their\n    position for the Second Stasimon._\n \n    AN ELDER. 0 Zeus, All-ruler, and Night the Aid,\n    Gainer of glories, and hast thou thrown\n    Over the towers of Ilion\n    Thy net close-laid,\n    That none so nimble and none so tall\n    Shall escape withal\n    The snare of the slaver that claspeth all? ANOTHER. And Zeus the Watcher of Friend and Friend\n    I also praise, who hath wrought this end. Long since on Paris his shaft he drew,\n    And hath aimed true,\n    Not too soon falling nor yet too far,\n    The fire of the avenging star. CHORUS. (_This is God's judgement upon Troy. May it not be too fierce! Gold cannot\n     save one who spurneth Justice_.) The stroke of Zeus hath found them! Clear this day\n    The tale, and plain to trace. He judged, and Troy hath fallen.--And have men said\n    That God not deigns to mark man's hardihead,\n    Trampling to earth the grace\n    Of holy and delicate things?--Sin lies that way. For visibly Pride doth breed its own return\n    On prideful men, who, when their houses swell\n    With happy wealth, breathe ever wrath and blood. Yet not too fierce let the due vengeance burn;\n    Only as deemeth well\n    One wise of mood. Never shall state nor gold\n    Shelter his heart from aching\n    Whoso the Altar of Justice old\n    Spurneth to Night unwaking. (_The Sinner suffers in his longing till at last Temptation overcomes him;\n     as longing for Helen overcame Paris._)\n \n    The tempting of misery forceth him, the dread\n    Child of fore-scheming Woe! And help is vain; the fell desire within\n    Is veiled not, but shineth bright like Sin:\n    And as false gold will show\n    Black where the touchstone trieth, so doth fade\n    His honour in God's ordeal. Like a child,\n    Forgetting all, he hath chased his winged bird,\n    And planted amid his people a sharp thorn. And no God hears his prayer, or, have they heard,\n    The man so base-beguiled\n    They cast to scorn. Paris to Argos came;\n    Love of a woman led him;\n    So God's altar he brought to shame,\n    Robbing the hand that fed him. (_Helen's flight; the visions seen by the King's seers; the phantom of\n     Helen and the King's grief._)\n \n    She hath left among her people a noise of shield and sword,\n    A tramp of men armed where the long ships are moored;\n She hath ta'en in her goings Desolation as a dower;\n She hath stept, stept quickly, through the great gated Tower,\n     And the thing that could not be, it hath been! And the Seers they saw visions, and they spoke of strange ill:\n     \"A Palace, a Palace; and a great King thereof:\n     A bed, a bed empty, that was once pressed in love:\n     And thou, thou, what art thou? Let us be, thou so still,\n     Beyond wrath, beyond beseeching, to the lips reft of thee!\" For she whom he desireth is beyond the deep sea,\n     And a ghost in his castle shall be queen. Images in sweet guise\n     Carven shall move him never,\n     Where is Love amid empty eyes? Gone, gone for ever! (_His dreams and his suffering; but the War that he made caused greater\n      and wider suffering._)\n \n     But a shape that is a dream, 'mid the phantoms of the night,\n     Cometh near, full of tears, bringing vain vain delight:\n     For in vain when, desiring, he can feel the joy's breath\n     --Nevermore! Nevermore!--from his arms it vanisheth,\n     On wings down the pathways of sleep. In the mid castle hall, on the hearthstone of the Kings,\n     These griefs there be, and griefs passing these,\n     But in each man's dwelling of the host that sailed the seas,\n     A sad woman waits; she has thoughts of many things,\n     And patience in her heart lieth deep. Knoweth she them she sent,\n     Knoweth she? Lo, returning,\n     Comes in stead of the man that went\n     Armour and dust of burning. (_The return of the funeral urns; the murmurs of the People._)\n \n     And the gold-changer, Ares, who changeth quick for dead,\n     Who poiseth his scale in the striving of the spears,\n     Back from Troy sendeth dust, heavy dust, wet with tears,\n     Sendeth ashes with men's names in his urns neatly spread. And they weep over the men, and they praise them one by one,\n     How this was a wise fighter, and this nobly-slain--\n     \"Fighting to win back another's wife!\" Till a murmur is begun,\n     And there steals an angry pain\n     Against Kings too forward in the strife. There by Ilion's gate\n     Many a soldier sleepeth,\n     Young men beautiful; fast in hate\n     Troy her conqueror keepeth. (_For the Shedder of Blood is in great peril, and not unmarked by God. May\n      I never be a Sacker of Cities!_)\n \n     But the rumour of the People, it is heavy, it is chill;\n     And tho' no curse be spoken, like a curse doth it brood;\n     And my heart waits some tiding which the dark holdeth still,\n     For of God not unmarked is the shedder of much blood. And who conquers beyond right ... Lo, the life of man decays;\n     There be Watchers dim his light in the wasting of the years;\n     He falls, he is forgotten, and hope dies. There is peril in the praise\n     Over-praised that he hears;\n     For the thunder it is hurled from God's eyes. Glory that breedeth strife,\n     Pride of the Sacker of Cities;\n Yea, and the conquered captive's life,\n    Spare me, O God of Pities!

I see a Herald yonder by the shore , Shadowed with olive sprays . And from his sore Rent raiment cries a witness from afar , Dry Dust , born brother to the Mire of war , That mute he comes not , neither through the smoke Of mountain forests shall his tale be spoke ; But either shouting for a joyful day , Or else .... But other thoughts I cast away . As good hath dawned , may good shine on , we pray ! -- And whoso for this City prayeth aught Else , let him reap the harvest of his thought !

A great light Cometh to men and gods out of the night . Grand greeting give him -- aye , it need be grand -- Who , God 's avenging mattock in his hand , Hath wrecked Troy 's towers and digged her soil beneath , Till her gods ' houses , they are things of death ; Her altars waste , and blasted every seed Whence life might rise ! So perfect is his deed , So dire the yoke on Ilion he hath cast , The first Atreides , King of Kings at last , And happy among men ! To whom we give Honour most high above all things that live . For Paris nor his guilty land can score The deed they wrought above the pain they bore . `` Spoiler and thief , '' he heard God 's judgement pass ; Whereby he lost his plunder , and like grass Mowed down his father 's house and all his land ; And Troy pays twofold for the sin she planned .

Who but a god goes woundless all his way ? .... Oh , could I tell the sick toil of the day , The evil nights , scant decks ill-blanketed ; The rage and cursing when our daily bread Came not ! And then on land 't was worse than all . Our quarters close beneath the enemy 's wall ; And rain -- and from the ground the river dew -- Wet , always wet ! Into our clothes it grew , Plague-like , and bred foul beasts in every hair . Would I could tell how ghastly midwinter Stole down from Ida till the birds dropped dead ! Or the still heat , when on his noonday bed The breathless blue sea sank without a wave ! .... Why think of it ? They are past and in the grave , All those long troubles . For I think the slain Care little if they sleep or rise again ; And we , the living , wherefore should we ache With counting all our lost ones , till we wake The old malignant fortunes ?

And mockers chid me : `` Because beacons show On the hills , must Troy be fallen ? Quickly born Are women 's hopes ! '' Aye , many did me scorn ; Yet gave I sacrifice ; and by my word Through all the city our woman 's cry was heard , Lifted in blessing round the seats of God , And slumbrous incense o'er the altars glowed In fragrance . And for thee , what need to tell Thy further tale ? My lord himself shall well Instruct me . Yet , to give my lord and king All reverent greeting at his homecoming -- What dearer dawn on woman 's eyes can flame Than this , which casteth wide her gate to acclaim The husband whom God leadeth safe from war ? -- Go , bear my lord this prayer : That fast and far He haste him to this town which loves his name ; And in his castle may he find the same Wife that he left , a watchdog of the hall , True to one voice and fierce to others all ; A body and soul unchanged , no seal of his Broke in the waiting years. -- No thought of ease Nor joy from other men hath touched my soul , Nor shall touch , until bronze be dyed like wool . A boast so faithful and so plain , I wot , Spoke by a royal Queen doth shame her not . [ _Exit_ CLYTEMNESTRA . LEADER . Let thine ear mark her message .

Then tell us of the storm . How , when God hurled His anger , did it rise ? How did it die ? HERALD . It likes me not , a day of presage high With dolorous tongue to stain . Those twain , I vow , Stand best apart . When one with shuddering brow , From armies lost , back beareth to his home Word that the terror of her prayers is come ; One wound in her great heart , and many a fate For many a home of men cast out to sate The two-fold scourge that worketh Ares ' lust , Spear crossed with spear , dust wed with bloody dust ; Who walketh laden with such weight of wrong , Why , let him , if he will , uplift the song That is Hell 's triumph . But to come as I Am now come , laden with deliverance high , Home to a land of peace and laughing eyes , And mar all with that fury of the skies Which made our Greeks curse God -- how should this be ? Two enemies most ancient , Fire and Sea , A sudden friendship swore , and proved their plight By war on us poor sailors through that night Of misery , when the horror of the wave Towered over us , and winds from Strymon drave Hull against hull , till good ships , by the horn Of the mad whirlwind gored and overborne , One here , one there , 'mid rain and blinding spray , Like sheep by a devil herded , passed away . And when the blessed Sun upraised his head , We saw the Aegean waste a-foam with dead , Dead men , dead ships , and spars disasterful . Howbeit for us , our one unwounded hull Out of that wrath was stolen or begged free By some good spirit -- sure no man was he ! -- Who guided clear our helm ; and on till now Hath Saviour Fortune throned her on the prow . No surge to mar our mooring , and no floor Of rock to tear us when we made for shore . Till , fled from that sea-hell , with the clear sun Above us and all trust in fortune gone , We drove like sheep about our brain the thoughts Of that lost army , broken and scourged with knouts Of evil . And , methinks , if there is breath In them , they talk of us as gone to death -- How else ? -- and so say we of them ! For thee , Since Menelaues thy first care must be , If by some word of Zeus , who wills not yet To leave the old house for ever desolate , Some ray of sunlight on a far-off sea Lights him , yet green and living ... we may see His ship some day in the harbour ! -- 'T was the word Of truth ye asked me for , and truth ye have heard ! [ _Exit_ HERALD . _The_ CHORUS _take position for the Third Stasimon_ . CHORUS . ( _Surely there was mystic meaning in the name_ HELENA , _meaning which was fulfilled when she fled to Troy._ ) Who was He who found for thee That name , truthful utterly -- Was it One beyond our vision Moving sure in pre-decision Of man 's doom his mystic lips ? -- Calling thee , the Battle-wed , Thee , the Strife-encompassed , HELEN ? Yea , in fate 's derision , Hell in cities , Hell in ships , Hell in hearts of men they knew her , When the dim and delicate fold Of her curtains backward rolled , And to sea , to sea , she threw her In the West Wind 's giant hold ; And with spear and sword behind her Came the hunters in a flood , Down the oarblade 's viewless trail Tracking , till in Simois ' vale Through the leaves they crept to find her , A Wrath , a seed of blood . ( _The Trojans welcomed her with triumph and praised Alexander till at last their song changed and they saw another meaning in Alexander 's name also._ ) So the Name to Ilion came On God 's thought-fulfilling flame , She a vengeance and a token Of the unfaith to bread broken , Of the hearth of God betrayed , Against them whose voices swelled Glorying in the prize they held And the Spoiler 's vaunt outspoken And the song his brethren made 'Mid the bridal torches burning ; Till , behold , the ancient City Of King Priam turned , and turning Took a new song for her learning , A song changed and full of pity , With the cry of a lost nation ; And she changed the bridegroom 's name : Called him Paris Ghastly-wed ; For her sons were with the dead , And her", "life one lamentation , 'Mid blood and burning flame . ( _Like a lion 's whelp reared as a pet and turning afterwards to a great beast of prey , _ ) Lo , once there was a herdsman reared In his own house , so stories tell , A lion 's whelp , a milk-fed thing And soft in life 's first opening Among the sucklings of the herd ; The happy children loved him well , And old men smiled , and oft , they say , In men 's arms , like a babe , he lay , Bright-eyed , and toward the hand that teased him Eagerly fawning for food or play . Then on a day outflashed the sudden Rage of the lion brood of yore ; He paid his debt to them that fed With wrack of herds and carnage red , Yea , wrought him a great feast unbidden , Till all the house-ways ran with gore ; A sight the thralls fled weeping from , A great red slayer , beard a-foam , High-priest of some blood-cursed altar God had uplifted against that home . ( _So was it with Helen in Troy._ ) And how shall I call the thing that came At the first hour to Ilion city ? Call it a dream of peace untold , A secret joy in a mist of gold , A woman 's eye that was soft , like flame , A flower which ate a man 's heart with pity . But she swerved aside and wrought to her kiss a bitter ending , And a wrath was on her harbouring , a wrath upon her friending , When to Priam and his sons she fled quickly o'er the deep , With the god to whom she sinned for her watcher on the wind , A death-bride , whom brides long shall weep . ( _Men say that Good Fortune wakes the envy of God ; not so ; Good Fortune may be innocent , and then there is no vengeance_ . ) A grey word liveth , from the morn Of old time among mortals spoken , That man 's Wealth waxen full shall fall Not childless , but get sons withal ; And ever of great bliss is born A tear unstanched and a heart broken . But I hold my thought alone and by others unbeguiled ; 'T is the deed that is unholy shall have issue , child on child , Sin on sin , like his begetters ; and they shall be as they were . But the man who walketh straight , and the house thereof , tho ' Fate Exalt him , the children shall be fair . _ ( It is Sin , it is Pride and Ruthlessness , that beget children like themselves till Justice is fulfilled upon them . ) _ But Old Sin loves , when comes the hour again , To bring forth New , Which laugheth lusty amid the tears of men ; Yea , and Unruth , his comrade , wherewith none May plead nor strive , which dareth on and on , Knowing not fear nor any holy thing ; Two fires of darkness in a house , born true , Like to their ancient spring . But Justice shineth in a house low-wrought With smoke-stained wall , And honoureth him who filleth his own lot ; But the unclean hand upon the golden stair With eyes averse she flieth , seeking where Things innocent are ; and , recking not the power Of wealth by man misgloried , guideth all To her own destined hour . [ _Here amid a great procession enter_ AGAMEMNON _on a Chariot .", "Behind\n him on another Chariot is_ CASSANDRA. _The_ CHORUS _approach and make\n obeisance. Some of_ AGAMEMNON'S _men have on their shields a White Horse,\n    some a Lion. Their arms are rich and partly barbaric_. LEADER. All hail, O King! Hail, Atreus' Son! Sacker of Cities! Ilion's bane! With what high word shall I greet thee again,\n    How give thee worship, and neither outrun\n    The point of pleasure, nor stint too soon? For many will cling. To fair seeming\n    The faster because they have sinned erewhile;\n    And a man may sigh with never a sting\n    Of grief in his heart, and a man may smile\n    With eyes unlit and a lip that strains. But the wise Shepherd knoweth his sheep,\n    And his eyes pierce deep\n    The faith like water that fawns and feigns. But I hide nothing, O King. That day\n    When in quest of Helen our battle array\n    Hurled forth, thy name upon my heart's scroll\n    Was deep in letters of discord writ;\n    And the ship of thy soul,\n    Ill-helmed and blindly steered was it,\n    Pursuing ever, through men that die,\n    One wild heart that was fain to fly. But on this new day,\n    From the deep of my thought and in love, I say\n    \"Sweet is a grief well ended;\"\n    And in time's flow Thou wilt learn and know\n    The true from the false,\n    Of them that were left to guard the walls\n    Of thine empty Hall unfriended. [_During the above_ CLYTEMNESTRA _has appeared on the Palace steps, with\n    a train of Attendants, to receive her Husband_. AGAMEMNON. To Argos and the gods of Argolis\n    All hail, who share with me the glory of this\n    Home-coming and the vengeance I did wreak\n    On Priam's City! Yea, though none should speak,\n    The great gods heard our cause, and in one mood\n    Uprising, in the urn of bitter blood,\n    That men should shriek and die and towers should burn,\n    Cast their great vote; while over Mercy's urn\n    Hope waved her empty hands and nothing fell. Even now in smoke that City tells her tale;\n    The wrack-wind liveth, and where Ilion died\n    The reek of the old fatness of her pride\n    From hot and writhing ashes rolls afar. For which let thanks, wide as our glories are,\n    Be uplifted; seeing the Beast of Argos hath\n    Round Ilion's towers piled high his fence of wrath\n    And, for one woman ravished, wrecked by force\n    A City. Lo, the leap of the wild Horse\n    in darkness when the Pleiades were dead;\n    A mailed multitude, a Lion unfed,\n    Which leapt the tower and lapt the blood of Kings! Lo, to the Gods I make these thanksgivings. But for thy words: I marked them, and I mind\n    Their meaning, and my voice shall be behind\n    Thine. For not many men, the proverb saith,\n    Can love a friend whom fortune prospereth\n    Unenvying; and about the envious brain\n    Cold poison clings, and doubles all the pain\n    Life brings him. His own woundings he must nurse,\n    And feels another's gladness like a curse. Well can I speak. I know the mirrored glass\n    Called friendship, and the shadow shapes that pass\n    And feign them a King's friends. I have known but one--\n    Odysseus, him we trapped against his own\n    Will!--who once harnessed bore his yoke right well ...\n    Be he alive or dead of whom I tell\n    The tale. And for the rest, touching our state\n    And gods, we will assemble in debate\n    A concourse of all Argos, taking sure\n    Counsel, that what is well now may endure\n    Well, and if aught needs healing medicine, still\n    By cutting and by fire, with all good will,\n    I will essay to avert the after-wrack\n    Such sickness breeds. Aye, Heaven hath led me back;\n    And on this hearth where still my fire doth burn\n    I will go pay to heaven my due return,\n    Which guides me here, which saved me far away. O Victory, now mine own, be mine alway! [CLYTEMNESTRA, _at the head of her retinue, steps forward. She controls\n    her suspense with difficulty but gradually gains courage as she proceeds._\n \n    CLYTEMNESTRA. Ye Elders, Council of the Argive name\n    Here present, I will no more hold it shame\n    To lay my passion bare before men's eyes. There comes a time to a woman when fear dies\n    For ever. None hath taught me. None could tell,\n    Save me, the weight of years intolerable\n    I lived while this man lay at Ilion. That any woman thus should sit alone\n    In a half-empty house, with no man near,\n    Makes her half-blind with dread! And in her ear\n    Alway some voice of wrath; now messengers\n    Of evil; now not so; then others worse,\n    Crying calamity against mine and me. Oh, had he half the wounds that variously\n    Came rumoured home, his flesh must be a net,\n    All holes from heel to crown! And if he met\n    As many deaths as I met tales thereon,\n    Is he some monstrous thing, some Geryon\n    Three-souled, that will not die, till o'er his head,\n    Three robes of earth be piled, to hold him dead? Aye, many a time my heart broke, and the noose\n    Of death had got me; but they cut me loose. It was those voices alway in mine ear. For that, too, young Orestes is not here\n    Beside me, as were meet, seeing he above\n    All else doth hold the surety of our love;\n    Let not thy heart be troubled. It fell thus:\n    Our loving spear-friend took him, Strophius\n    The Phocian, who forewarned me of annoy\n    Two-fronted, thine own peril under Troy,\n    And ours here, if the rebel multitude\n    Should cast the Council down. It is men's mood\n    Alway, to spurn the fallen. So spake he,\n    And sure no guile was in him. But for me,\n    The old stormy rivers of my grief are dead\n    Now at the spring; not one tear left unshed. Mine eyes are sick with vigil, endlessly\n    Weeping the beacon-piles that watched for thee\n    For ever answerless. And did I dream,\n    A gnat's thin whirr would start me, like a scream\n    Of battle, and show me thee by terrors swept,\n    Crowding, too many for the time I slept. From all which stress delivered and free-souled,\n    I greet my lord: O watchdog of the fold,\n    O forestay sure that fails not in the squall,\n    O strong-based pillar of a towering hall;\n O single son to a father age-ridden;\n O land unhoped for seen by shipwrecked men;\n Sunshine more beautiful when storms are fled;\n Spring of quick water in a desert dead ....\n How sweet to be set free from any chain! These be my words to greet him home again. No god shall grudge them. Surely I and thou\n Have suffered in time past enough! And now\n Dismount, O head with love and glory crowned,\n    From this high car; yet plant not on bare ground\n    Thy foot, great King, the foot that trampled Troy. Ho, bondmaids, up! Forget not your employ,\n    A floor of crimson broideries to spread\n    For the King's path. Let all the ground be red\n    Where those feet pass; and Justice, dark of yore,\n    Home light him to the hearth he looks not for! What followeth next, our sleepless care shall see\n    Ordered as God's good pleasure may decree. [_The attendants spread tapestries of crimson and gold from the Chariot\n    to the Door of the Palace._ AGAMEMNON _does not move_. AGAMEMNON. Daughter of Leda, watcher of my fold,\n    In sooth thy welcome, grave and amply told,\n    Fitteth mine absent years. Though it had been\n    Seemlier, methinks, some other, not my Queen,\n    Had spoke these honours. For the rest, I say,\n    Seek not to make me soft in woman's way;\n Cry not thy praise to me wide-mouthed, nor fling\n Thy body down, as to some barbarous king. Nor yet with broidered hangings strew my path,\n     To awake the unseen ire. 'Tis God that hath\n     Such worship; and for mortal man to press\n     Rude feet upon this broidered loveliness ... I vow there is danger in it. Let my road\n     Be honoured, surely; but as man, not god. Rugs for the feet and yonder broidered pall ... The names ring diverse!... Aye, and not to fall\n     Suddenly blind is of all gifts the best\n     God giveth, for I reckon no man blest\n     Ere to the utmost goal his race be run. So be it; and if, as this day I have done,\n     I shall do always, then I fear no ill.\n \n     CLYTEMNESTRA. Tell me but this, nowise against thy will ...\n \n     AGAMEMNON. My will, be sure, shall falter not nor fade. CLYTEMNESTRA. Was this a vow in some great peril made? AGAMEMNON. Enough! I have spoke my purpose, fixed and plain. CLYTEMNESTRA. Were Priam the conqueror ... Think, would he refrain? AGAMEMNON. Oh, stores of broideries would be trampled then! CLYTEMNESTRA. Lord, care not for the cavillings of men! AGAMEMNON. The murmur of a people hath strange weight. CLYTEMNESTRA. Who feareth envy, feareth to be great. AGAMEMNON. 'Tis graceless when a woman strives to lead. CLYTEMNESTRA. When a great conqueror yields, 'tis grace indeed,\n \n     AGAMEMNON. So in this war thou must my conqueror be? CLYTEMNESTRA. Yield! With good will to yield is victory! AGAMEMNON. Well, if I needs must ... Be it as thou hast said! Quick! Loose me these bound slaves on which I tread,\n     And while I walk yon wonders of the sea\n     God grant no eye of wrath be cast on me\n     From far! [_The Attendants untie his shoes_. For even now it likes me not\n     To waste mine house, thus marring underfoot\n     The pride thereof, and wondrous broideries\n     Bought in far seas with silver. But of these\n     Enough.--And mark, I charge thee, this princess\n     Of Ilion; tend her with all gentleness. God's eye doth see, and loveth from afar,\n     The merciful conqueror. For no slave of war\n     Is slave by his own will. She is the prize\n     And chosen flower of Ilion's treasuries,\n     Set by the soldiers' gift to follow me. Now therefore, seeing I am constrained by thee\n     And do thy will, I walk in conqueror's guise\n     Beneath my Gate, trampling sea-crimson dyes. [_As he dismounts and sets foot on the Tapestries_ CLYTEMNESTRA'S _women\n     utter again their Cry of Triumph. The people bow or kneel as he passes._\n \n     CLYTEMNESTRA. There is the sea--its caverns who shall drain?--\n     Breeding of many a purple-fish the stain\n     Surpassing silver, ever fresh renewed,\n     For robes of kings. And we, by right indued,\n     Possess our fill thereof. Thy house, O King,\n     Knoweth no stint, nor lack of anything. What trampling of rich raiment, had the cry\n     So sounded in the domes of prophesy,\n     Would I have vowed these years, as price to pay\n     For this dear life in peril far away! Where the root is, the leafage cometh soon\n     To clothe an house, and spread its leafy boon\n     Against the burning star; and, thou being come,\n     Thou, on the midmost hearthstone of thy home,\n     Oh, warmth in winter leapeth to thy sign. And when God's summer melteth into wine\n     The green grape, on that house shall coolness fall\n     Where the true man, the master, walks his hall. Zeus, Zeus! True Master, let my prayers be true! And, oh, forget not that thou art willed to do! [_She follows_ AGAMEMNON _into the Palace. The retinues of both King and\n     Queen go in after them._ CASSANDRA _remains_. CHORUS.", "What is this that evermore,                         [_Strophe 1._\n     A cold terror at the door\n     Of this bosom presage-haunted,\n     Pale as death hovereth? While a song unhired, unwanted,\n     By some inward prophet chanted,\n     Speaks the secret at its core;\n And to cast it from my blood\n Like a dream not understood\n No sweet-spoken Courage now\n Sitteth at my heart's dear prow. Yet I know that manifold\n Days, like sand, have waxen old\n \n Since the day those shoreward-thrown\n Cables flapped and line on line\n Standing forth for Ilion\n The long galleys took the brine\n \n [_Antistrophe 1._\n And in harbour--mine own eye\n Hath beheld--again they lie;\n Yet that lyreless music hidden\n Whispers still words of ill,\n          'Tis the Soul of me unbidden,\n          Like some Fury sorrow-ridden,\n          Weeping over things that die. Neither waketh in my sense\n          Ever Hope's dear confidence;\n          For this flesh that groans within,\n          And these bones that know of Sin,\n          This tossed heart upon the spate\n          Of a whirpool that is Fate,\n          Surely these lie not. Yet deep\n          Beneath hope my prayer doth run,\n          All will die like dreams, and creep\n          To the unthought of and undone.

[_Suddenly_ CLYTEMNESTRA _appears standing in the Doorway._\n \n          CLYTEMNESTRA. Thou likewise, come within! I speak thy name,\n          Cassandra;\n \n [CASSANDRA _trembles, but continues to stare in front of her, as though\n not hearing_ CLYTEMNESTRA. seeing the Gods--why chafe at them?--\n Have placed thee here, to share within these walls\n Our lustral waters, 'mid a crowd of thralls\n Who stand obedient round the altar-stone\n Of our Possession. Therefore come thou down,\n    And be not over-proud. The tale is told\n    How once Alcmena's son himself, being sold,\n    Was patient, though he liked not the slaves' mess. And more, if Fate must bring thee to this stress,\n    Praise God thou art come to a House of high report\n    And wealth from long ago. The baser sort,\n    Who have reaped some sudden harvest unforeseen,\n    Are ever cruel to their slaves, and mean\n    In the measure. We shall give whate'er is due. [CASSANDRA _is silent._\n \n    LEADER. To thee she speaks, and waits ... clear words and true! Oh, doom is all around thee like a net;\n    Yield, if thou canst.... Belike thou canst not yet. CLYTEMNESTRA. Methinks, unless this wandering maid is one\n    Voiced like a swallow-bird, with tongue unknown\n    And barbarous, she can read my plain intent. I use but words, and ask for her consent. LEADER. Ah, come! Tis best, as the world lies to-day. Leave this high-throned chariot, and obey! CLYTEMNESTRA. How long must I stand dallying at the Gate? Even now the beasts to Hestia consecrate\n    Wait by the midmost fire, since there is wrought\n    This high fulfilment for which no man thought. Wherefore, if 'tis thy pleasure to obey\n    Aught of my will, prithee, no more delay! If, dead to sense, thou wilt not understand...\n    Thou show her, not with speech but with brute hand! [_To the Leader of the_ CHORUS. LEADER. The strange maid needs a rare interpreter. She is trembling like a wild beast in a snare. CLYTEMNESTRA. 'Fore God, she is mad, and heareth but her own\n    Folly! A slave, her city all o'erthrown,\n    She needs must chafe her bridle, till this fret\n    Be foamed away in blood and bitter sweat. I waste no more speech, thus to be defied. [_She goes back inside the Palace_. LEADER. I pity thee so sore, no wrath nor pride\n    Is in me.--Come, dismount! Bend to the stroke\n    Fate lays on thee, and learn to feel thy yoke. [_He lays his hand softly on_ CASSANDRA'S _shoulder_. CASSANDRA (_moaning to herself_).", "Otototoi ... Dreams. Dreams. Apollo. O Apollo! SECOND ELDER. Why sob'st thou for Apollo? It is writ,\n    He loves not grief nor lendeth ear to it. CASSANDRA. Otototoi ... Dreams. Dreams. Apollo. O Apollo! LEADER. Still to that god she makes her sobbing cry\n    Who hath no place where men are sad, or die. CASSANDRA. Apollo, Apollo! Light of the Ways of Men! Mine enemy! Hast lighted me to darkness yet again? SECOND ELDER. How? Will she prophesy about her own\n    Sorrows? That power abides when all is gone! CASSANDRA. Apollo, Apollo! Light of all that is! Mine enemy! Where hast thou led me? ... Ha! What house is this? LEADER. The Atreidae's castle. If thou knowest not, I\n    Am here to help thee, and help faithfully. CASSANDRA (_whispering_). Nay, nay. This is the house that God hateth. There be many things that know its secret; sore\n    And evil things; murders and strangling death. 'Tis here they slaughter men...A splashing floor. SECOND ELDER. Keen-sensed the strange maid seemeth, like a hound\n    For blood.--And what she seeks can sure be found! CASSANDRA. The witnesses ... I follow where they lead. The crying ... of little children ... near the gate:\n    Crying for wounds that bleed:\n    And the smell of the baked meats their father ate. SECOND ELDER (_recognizing her vision, and repelled_). Word of thy mystic power had reached our ear\n    Long since. Howbeit we need no prophets here. CASSANDRA. Ah, ah! What would they? A new dreadful thing. A great great sin plots in the house this day;\n    Too strong for the faithful, beyond medicining ...\n    And help stands far away. LEADER. This warning I can read not, though I knew\n    That other tale. It rings the city through. CASSANDRA. O Woman, thou! The lord who lay with thee! Wilt lave with water, and then ... How speak the end? It comes so quick. A hand ... another hand ...\n    That reach, reach gropingly....\n \n    LEADER. I see not yet. These riddles, pierced with blind\n    Gleams of foreboding, but bemuse my mind. CASSANDRA. Ah, ah! What is it? There; it is coming clear. A net ... some net of Hell. Nay, she that lies with him ... is she the snare? And half of his blood upon it. It holds well....\n    O Crowd of ravening Voices, be glad, yea, shout\n    And cry for the stoning, cry for the casting out! SECOND ELDER. What Fury Voices call'st thou to be hot\n    Against this castle? Such words like me not. And deep within my breast I felt that sick\n    And saffron drop, which creepeth to the heart\n    To die as the last rays of life depart. Misfortune comes so quick. CASSANDRA. Ah, look! Look! Keep his mate from the Wild Bull! A tangle of raiment, see;\n    A black horn, and a blow, and he falleth, full\n    In the marble amid the water. I counsel ye. I speak plain ... Blood in the bath and treachery! LEADER. No great interpreter of oracles\n    Am I; but this, I think, some mischief spells. What spring of good hath seercraft ever made\n    Up from the dark to flow? 'Tis but a weaving of words, a craft of woe,\n    To make mankind afraid. CASSANDRA. Poor woman! Poor dead woman! ... Yea, it is I,\n    Poured out like water among them. Weep for me....\n    Ah! What is this place? Why must I come with thee....\n    To die, only to die? LEADER. Thou art borne on the breath of God, thou spirit wild,\n    For thine own weird to wail,\n    Like to that winged voice, that heart so sore\n    Which, crying alway, hungereth to cry more,\n    \"Itylus, Itylus,\" till it sing her child\n    Back to the nightingale. CASSANDRA. Oh, happy Singing Bird, so sweet, so clear! Soft wings for her God made,\n    And an easy passing, without pain or tear ...\n    For me 'twill be torn flesh and rending blade. SECOND ELDER. Whence is it sprung, whence wafted on God's breath,\n    This anguish reasonless? This throbbing of terror shaped to melody,\n    Moaning of evil blent with music high? Who hath marked out for thee that mystic path\n    Through thy woe's wilderness? CASSANDRA. Alas for the kiss, the kiss of Paris, his people's bane! Alas for Scamander Water, the water my fathers drank! Long, long ago, I played about thy bank,\n    And was cherished and grew strong;\n Now by a River of Wailing, by shores of Pain,\n     Soon shall I make my song. LEADER. How sayst thou? All too clear,\n     This ill word thou hast laid upon thy mouth! A babe could read thee plain. It stabs within me like a serpent's tooth,\n     The bitter thrilling music of her pain:\n     I marvel as I hear. CASSANDRA. Alas for the toil, the toil of a City, worn unto death! Alas for my father's worship before the citadel,\n     The flocks that bled and the tumult of their breath! But no help from them came\n     To save Troy Towers from falling as they fell!... And I on the earth shall writhe, my heart aflame. SECOND ELDER. Dark upon dark, new ominous words of ill! Sure there hath swept on thee some Evil Thing,\n     Crushing, which makes thee bleed\n     And in the torment of thy vision sing\n     These plaining death-fraught oracles ... Yet still, still,\n     Their end I cannot read! CASSANDRA. [_By an effort she regains mastery of herself, and speaks directly to\n     the Leader_.", "'Fore God, mine oracle shall no more hide\n     With veils his visage, like a new-wed bride! A shining wind out of this dark shall blow,\n     Piercing the dawn, growing as great waves grow,\n     To burst in the heart of sunrise ... stronger far\n     Than this poor pain of mine. I will not mar\n     With mists my wisdom. Be near me as I go,\n     Tracking the evil things of long ago,\n     And bear me witness. For this roof, there clings\n     Music about it, like a choir which sings\n     One-voiced, but not well-sounding, for not good\n     The words are. Drunken, drunken, and with blood,\n     To make them dare the more, a revelling rout\n     Is in the rooms, which no man shall cast out,\n     Of sister Furies. And they weave to song,\n     Haunting the House, its first blind deed of wrong,\n     Spurning in turn that King's bed desecrate,\n     Defiled, which paid a brother's sin with hate....\n     Hath it missed or struck, mine arrow? Am I a poor\n     Dreamer, that begs and babbles at the door? Give first thine oath in witness, that I know\n     Of this great dome the sins wrought long ago. ELDER. And how should oath of mine, though bravely sworn,\n     Appease thee? Yet I marvel that one born\n     Far over seas, of alien speech, should fall\n     So apt, as though she had lived here and seen all. CASSANDRA. The Seer Apollo made me too to see. ELDER (_in a low voice_). Was the God's heart pierced with desire for thee? CASSANDRA. Time was, I held it shame hereof to speak. ELDER. Ah, shame is for the mighty, not the weak. CASSANDRA. We wrestled, and his breath to me was sweet. ELDER. Ye came to the getting of children, as is meet? CASSANDRA. I swore to Loxias, and I swore a lie. ELDER. Already thine the gift of prophecy? CASSANDRA. Already I showed my people all their path. ELDER. And Loxias did not smite thee in his wrath? CASSANDRA. After that sin ... no man believed me more. ELDER. Nay, then, to us thy wisdom seemeth sure. CASSANDRA. Oh, oh! Agony, agony! Again the awful pains of prophecy\n     Are on me, maddening as they fall....\n     Ye see them there ... beating against the wall? So young ... like shapes that gather in a dream ...\n     Slain by a hand they loved. Children they seem,\n     Murdered ... and in their hands they bear baked meat:\n     I think it is themselves. Yea, flesh; I see it;\n     And inward parts.... Oh, what a horrible load\n     To carry! And their father drank their blood. From these, I warn ye, vengeance broodeth still,\n     A lion's rage, which goes not forth to kill\n     But lurketh in his lair, watching the high\n     Hall of my war-gone master ... Master? Aye;\n     Mine, mine! The yoke is nailed about my neck....\n     Oh, lord of ships and trampler on the wreck\n     Of Ilion, knows he not this she-wolf's tongue,\n     Which licks and fawns, and laughs with ear up-sprung,\n     To bite in the end like secret death?--And can\n     The woman? Slay a strong and armed man? ...\n     What fanged reptile like to her doth creep? Some serpent amphisbene, some Skylla, deep\n     Housed in the rock, where sailors shriek and die,\n     Mother of Hell blood-raging, which doth cry\n     On her own flesh war, war without alloy ...\n     God! And she shouted in his face her joy,\n     Like men in battle when the foe doth break. And feigns thanksgiving for his safety's sake! What if no man believe me? 'Tis all one. The thing which must be shall be; aye, and soon\n     Thou too shalt sorrow for these things, and here\n     Standing confess me all too true a seer. LEADER. The Thyestean feast of children slain\n     I understood, and tremble. Aye, my brain\n     Reels at these visions, beyond guesswork true. But after, though I heard, I had lost the clue. CASSANDRA. Man, thou shalt look on Agamemnon dead. LEADER. Peace, Mouth of Evil! Be those words unsaid! CASSANDRA. No god of peace hath watch upon that hour. LEADER. If it must come. Forefend it, Heavenly Power! CASSANDRA. They do not think of prayer; they think of death. LEADER. They? Say, what man this foul deed compasseth? CASSANDRA. Alas, thou art indeed fallen far astray! LEADER. How could such deed be done? I see no way. CASSANDRA. Yet know I not the Greek tongue all too well? LEADER. Greek are the Delphic dooms, but hard to spell. CASSANDRA. Ah! Ah! There! What a strange fire! It moves ... It comes at me. O Wolf Apollo, mercy! O agony! ...\n     Why lies she with a wolf, this lioness lone,\n     Two-handed, when the royal lion is gone? God, she will kill me! Like to them that brew\n     Poison, I see her mingle for me too\n     A separate vial in her wrath, and swear,\n     Whetting her blade for him, that I must share\n     His death ... because, because he hath dragged me here! Oh, why these mockers at my throat? This gear\n     Of wreathed bands, this staff of prophecy? I mean to kill you first, before I die. Begone! [_She tears off her prophetic habiliments; and presently throws them on\n     the ground, and stamps on them._\n \n     Down to perdition! ... Lie ye so? So I requite you! Now make rich in woe\n     Some other Bird of Evil, me no more! [_Coming to herself._\n     Ah, see! It is Apollo's self, hath tore\n     His crown from me! Who watched me long ago\n     In this same prophet's robe, by friend, by foe,\n     All with one voice, all blinded, mocked to scorn:\n     \"A thing of dreams,\" \"a beggar-maid outworn,\"\n     Poor, starving and reviled, I endured all;\n     And now the Seer, who called me till my call\n     Was perfect, leads me to this last dismay....\n     'Tis not the altar-stone where men did slay\n     My father; 'tis a block, a block with gore\n     Yet hot, that waits me, of one slain before. Yet not of God unheeded shall we lie. There cometh after, one who lifteth high\n     The downfallen; a branch where blossometh\n     A sire's avenging and a mother's death. Exiled and wandering, from this land outcast,\n     One day He shall return, and set the last\n     Crown on these sins that have his house downtrod. For, lo, there is a great oath sworn of God,\n     His father's upturned face shall guide him home. Why should I grieve? Why pity these men's doom? I who have seen the City of Ilion\n     Pass as she passed; and they who cast her down\n     Have thus their end, as God gives judgement sure.... I go to drink my cup. I will endure\n     To die. O Gates, Death-Gates, all hail to you! Only, pray God the blow be stricken true! Pray God, unagonized, with blood that flows\n     Quick unto friendly death, these eyes may close! LEADER. O full of sorrows, full of wisdom great,\n     Woman, thy speech is a long anguish; yet,\n     Knowing thy doom, why walkst thou with clear eyes,\n     Like some god-blinded beast, to sacrifice? CASSANDRA. There is no escape, friends; only vain delay. LEADER. Is not the later still the sweeter day? CASSANDRA. The day is come. Small profit now to fly. LEADER. Through all thy griefs, Woman, thy heart is high. CASSANDRA. Alas! None that is happy hears that praise. LEADER. Are not the brave dead blest in after days? CASSANDRA. O Father! O my brethren brave, I come! [_She moves towards the House, but recoils shuddering._\n \n     LEADER. What frights thee? What is that thou startest from? CASSANDRA. Ah, faugh! Faugh! LEADER. What turns thee in that blind\n     Horror? Unless some loathing of the mind ...\n \n     CASSANDRA. Death drifting from the doors, and blood like rain! LEADER. 'Tis but the dumb beasts at the altar slain. CASSANDRA. And vapours from a charnel-house ... See there! LEADER. 'Tis Tyrian incense clouding in the air. CASSANDRA (_recovering herself again_). So be it!--I will go, in yonder room\n     To weep mine own and Agamemnon's doom. May death be all! Strangers, I am no bird\n     That pipeth trembling at a thicket stirred\n     By the empty wind. Bear witness on that day\n     When woman for this woman's life shall pay,\n     And man for man ill-mated low shall lie:\n     I ask this boon, as being about to die. LEADER. Alas, I pity thee thy mystic fate! CASSANDRA. One word, one dirge-song would I utter yet\n     O'er mine own corpse. To this last shining Sun\n     I pray that, when the Avenger's work is done,\n     His enemies may remember this thing too,\n     This little thing, the woman slave they slew! O world of men, farewell! A painted show\n     Is all thy glory; and when life is low\n     The touch of a wet sponge out-blotteth all. Oh, sadder this than any proud man's fall! [_She goes into the House._\n \n     CHORUS. Great Fortune is an hungry thing,\n     And filleth no heart anywhere,\n     Though men with fingers menacing\n     Point at the great house, none will dare,\n     When Fortune knocks, to bar the door\n     Proclaiming: \"Come thou here no more!\" Lo, to this man the Gods have given\n     Great Ilion in the dust to tread\n     And home return, emblazed of heaven;\n     If it is writ, he too shall go\n     Through blood for blood spilt long ago;\n     If he too, dying for the dead,\n     Should crown the deaths of alien years,\n     What mortal afar off, who hears,\n     Shall boast him Fortune's Child, and led\n     Above the eternal tide of tears? [_A sudden Cry from within._\n \n     VOICE. Ho! Treason in the house! I am wounded: slain. LEADER. Hush! In the castle! 'Twas a cry\n     Of some man wounded mortally. VOICE. Ah God, another! I am stricken again. LEADER. I think the deed is done. It was the King\n     Who groaned.... Stand close, and think if anything....\n \n     [_The Old Men gather together under the shock, and debate confusedly._\n \n     ELDER B.\n \n     I give you straight my judgement. Summon all\n     The citizens to rescue. Sound a call! ELDER C.\n \n     No, no! Burst in at once without a word! In, and convict them by their dripping sword! ELDER D.\n \n     Yes; that or something like it. Quick, I say,\n     Be doing! 'Tis a time for no delay. ELDER E.\n \n     We have time to think. This opening ... They have planned\n     Some scheme to make enslavement of the land. ELDER F.\n \n     Yes, while we linger here! They take no thought\n     Of lingering, and their sword-arm sleepeth not! ELDER G.\n \n     I have no counsel. I can speak not. Oh,\n     Let him give counsel who can strike a blow! ELDER H.\n \n     I say as this man says. I have no trust\n     In words to raise a dead man from the dust. ELDER I. How mean you? Drag out our poor lives, and stand\n     Cowering to these defilers of the land? ELDER J.\n \n     Nay, 'tis too much! Better to strive and die! Death is an easier doom than slavery. ELDER K.\n \n     We heard a sound of groaning, nothing plain,\n     How know we--are we seers?--that one is slain? ELDER L.\n \n     Oh, let us find the truth out, ere we grow\n     Thus passionate! To surmise is not to know. LEADER. Break in, then! 'Tis the counsel ye all bring,\n     And learn for sure, how is it with the King. [_They cluster up towards the Palace Door, as though to force an\n     entrance, when the great Door swings open, revealing_ CLYTEMNESTRA, _who\n     stands, axe in hand, over the dead bodies of_ AGAMEMNON _and_ CASSANDRA.", "_The body of_ AGAMEMNON _is wrapped in a rich crimson web . There is blood on_ CLYTEMNESTRA'S_ brow , and she speaks in wild triumph._ CLYTEMNESTRA . Oh , lies enough and more have I this day Spoken , which now I shame not to unsay . How should a woman work , to the utter end , Hate on a damned hater , feigned a friend ; How pile perdition round him , hunter-wise , Too high for overleaping , save by lies ? To me this hour was dreamed of long ago ; A thing of ancient hate . 'T was very slow In coming , but it came . And here I stand Even where I struck , with all the deed I planned Done ! 'T was so wrought -- what boots it to deny ? -- The man could neither guard himself nor fly . An endless web , as by some fisher strung , A deadly plenteousness of robe , I flung All round him , and struck twice ; and with two cries His limbs turned water and broke ; and as he lies I cast my third stroke in , a prayer well-sped To Zeus of Hell , who guardeth safe his dead ! So there he gasped his life out as he lay ; And , gasping , the blood spouted ... Like dark spray That splashed , it came , a salt and deathly dew ; Sweet , sweet as God 's dear rain-drops ever blew O'er a parched field , the day the buds are born ! ... Which things being so , ye Councillors high-born , Depart in joy , if joy ye will . For me , I glory . Oh , if such a thing might be As o'er the dead thank-offering to outpour , On this dead it were just , aye , just and more , Who filled the cup of the House with treacheries Curse-fraught , and here hath drunk it to the lees ! LEADER . We are astonied at thy speech . To fling , Wild mouth ! such vaunt over thy murdered King ! CLYTEMNESTRA . Wouldst fright me , like a witless woman ? Lo , This bosom shakes not . And , though well ye know , I tell you ... Curse me as ye will , or bless , 'T is all one ... This is Agamemnon ; this , My husband , dead by my right hand , a blow Struck by a righteous craftsman . Aye , 't is so . CHORUS . Woman , what evil tree , What poison grown of the ground Or draught of the drifting sea Way to thy lips hath found , Making thee clothe thy heart In rage , yea , in curses burning When thine own people pray ? Thou hast hewn , thou hast cast away ; And a thing cast away thou art , A thing of hate and a spurning ! CLYTEMNESTRA . Aye , now , for me , thou hast thy words of fate ; Exile from Argos and the people 's hate For ever ! Against him no word was cried , When , recking not , as 'twere a beast that died , With flocks abounding o'er his wide domain , He slew his child , my love , my flower of pain , ... Great God , as magic for the winds of Thrace ! Why was not he man-hunted from his place , To purge the blood that stained him ? ... When the deed Is mine , oh , then thou art a judge indeed ! But threat thy fill . I am ready , and I stand Content ; if thy hand beateth down my hand , Thou rulest . If aught else be God 's decree , Thy lesson shall be learned , though late it be . CHORUS . Thy thought , it is very proud ; Thy breath is the scorner 's breath ; Is not the madness loud In thy heart , being drunk with death ? Yea , and above thy brow A star of the wet blood burneth ! Oh , doom shall have yet her day , The last friend cast away , When lie doth answer lie And a stab for a stab returneth ! CLYTEMNESTRA . And heark what Oath-gods gather to my side ! By my dead child 's Revenge , now satisfied , By Mortal Blindness , by all Powers of Hell Which Hate , to whom in sacrifice he fell , My Hope shall walk not in the house of Fear , While on my hearth one fire yet burneth clear , One lover , one Aigisthos , as of old ! What should I fear , when fallen here I hold This foe , this scorner of his wife , this toy And fool of each Chryseis under Troy ; And there withal his soothsayer and slave , His chanting bed-fellow , his leman brave , Who rubbed the galleys ' benches at his side . But , oh , they had their guerdon as they died ! For he lies thus , and she , the wild swan 's way , Hath trod her last long weeping roundelay , And lies , his lover , ravisht o'er the main For his bed 's comfort and my deep disdain . CHORUS . ( _Some Elders_ . ) Would God that suddenly With no great agony , No long sick-watch to keep , My hour would come to me , My hour , and presently Bring the eternal , the Unwaking Sleep , Now that my Shepherd , he Whose love watched over me , Lies in the deep ! ANOTHER . For woman 's sake he endured and battled well , And by a woman 's hand he fell . OTHERS . What hast thou done , O Helen blind of brain , O face that slew the souls on Ilion 's plain , One face , one face , and many a thousand slain ? The hate of old that on this castle lay , Builded in lust , a husband 's evil day , Hath bloomed for thee a perfect flower again And unforgotten , an old and burning stain Never to pass away . CLYTEMNESTRA . Nay , pray not for the hour of death , being tried Too sore beneath these blows Neither on Helen turn thy wrath aside , The Slayer of Men , the face which hath destroyed Its thousand Danaan souls , and wrought a wide Wound that no leech can close . CHORUS . -- Daemon , whose heel is set On the House and the twofold kin Of the high Tantalidae , A power , heavy as fate , Thou wieldest through woman 's sin , Piercing the heart of me ! -- Like a raven swoln with hate He hath set on the dead his claw , He croaketh a song to sate His fury , and calls it Law ! CLYTEMNESTRA . Ah , call upon Him ! Yea , call -- And thy thought hath found its path -- The Daemon who haunts this hall , The thrice-engorged Wrath ; From him is the ache of the flesh For blood born and increased ; Ere the old sore hath ceased It oozeth afresh . CHORUS . -- Indeed He is very great , And heavy his anger , He , The Daemon who guides the fate Of the old Tantalidae : Alas , alas , an evil tale ye tell Of desolate angers and insatiable ! -- Ah me , And yet 't is all as Zeus hath willed , Doer of all and Cause of all ; By His Word every chance doth fall , No end without Him is fulfilled ; What of these things But cometh by high Heaven 's counsellings ? [ _A band of Mourners has gathered within the House_ . MOURNERS . Ah , sorrow , sorrow ! My King , my King ! How shall I weep , what word shall I say ? Caught in the web of this spider thing , In foul death gasping thy life away ! Woe 's me , woe 's me , for this slavish lying , The doom of craft and the lonely dying , The iron two-edged and the hands that slay ! CLYTEMNESTRA . And criest thou still this deed hath been My work ? Nay , gaze , and have no thought That this is Agamemnon 's Queen . 'T is He , 't is He , hath round him wrought This phantom of the dead man 's wife ; He , the old Wrath , the Driver of Men astray , Pursuer of Atreus for the feast defiled ; To assoil an ancient debt he hath paid this life ; A warrior and a crowned King this day Atones for a slain child . CHORUS . -- That thou art innocent herein , What tongue dare boast ? It can not be , Yet from the deeps of ancient sin The Avenger may have wrought with thee . -- On the red Slayer crasheth , groping wild For blood , more blood , to build his peace again , And wash like water the old frozen stain Of the torn child . MOURNERS . Ah , sorrow , sorrow ! My King , my King ! How shall I weep , what word shall I say ? Caught in the web of this spider thing , In foul death gasping thy life away . Woe 's me , woe 's me , for this slavish lying , The doom of craft and the lonely dying , The iron two-edged and the hands that slay ! CLYTEMNESTRA . And what of the doom of craft that first He planted , making the House accurst ? What of the blossom , from this root riven , Iphigenia , the unforgiven ? Even as the wrong was , so is the pain : He shall not laugh in the House of the slain , When the count is scored ; He hath but spoiled and paid again The due of the sword . CHORUS . I am lost ; my mind dull-eyed Knows not nor feels Whither to fly nor hide While the House reels . The noise of rain that falls On the roof affrighteth me , Washing away the walls ; Rain that falls bloodily . Doth ever the sound abate ? Lo , the next Hour of Fate Whetting her vengeance due On new whet-stones , for new Workings of hate . MOURNERS . Would thou hadst covered me , Earth , O Earth , Or e'er I had looked on my lord thus low , In the palled marble of silvern girth ! What hands may shroud him , what tears may flow ? Not thine , O Woman who dared to slay him , Thou durst not weep to him now , nor pray him , Nor pay to his soul the deep unworth Of gift or prayer to forget thy blow . -- Oh , who with heart sincere Shall bring praise or grief To lay on the sepulchre Of the great chief ? CLYTEMNESTRA . His burial is not thine to array . By me he fell , by me he died , I watch him to the grave , not cried By mourners of his housefolk ; nay , His own child for a day like this Waits , as is seemly , and shall run By the white waves of Acheron To fold him in her arms and kiss ! CHORUS . Lo , she who was erst reviled Revileth ; and who shall say ? Spoil taken from them that spoiled , Life-blood from them that slay ! Surely while God ensueth His laws , while Time doth run 'T is written : On him that doeth It shall be done . This is God 's law and grace , Who then shall hunt the race Of curses from out this hall ? The House is sealed withal To dreadfulness . CLYTEMNESTRA . Aye , thou hast found the Law , and stept In Truth 's way. -- Yet even now I call The Living Wrath which haunts this hall To truce and compact . I accept All the affliction he doth heap Upon me , and I charge him go Far off with his self-murdering woe To strange men 's houses . I will keep Some little dower , and leave behind All else , contented utterly . I have swept the madness from the sky Wherein these brethren slew their kind . [ _As she ceases , exhausted and with the fire gone out of her , _ AIGISTHOS , _with Attendants , bursts triumphantly in._ AIGISTHOS . O shining day , O dawn of righteousness Fulfilled ! Now , now indeed will I confess That divine watchers o'er man 's death and birth Look down on all the anguish of the earth , Now that I see him lying , as I love To see him , in this net the Furies wove , To atone the old craft of his father 's hand . For Atreus , this man 's father , in this land Reigning , and by Thyestes in his throne Challenged -- he was his brother and mine own Father From home and city cast him out ; And he , after long exile , turned about And threw him suppliant on the hearth , and won Promise of so much mercy , that his own Life-blood should reek not in his father 's hall . Then did that godless brother , Atreus , call , To greet my sire -- More eagerness , O God , Was there than love ! -- a feast of brotherhood . And , feigning joyous banquet , laid as meat Before him his dead children . The white feet And finger-fringed hands apart he set , Veiled from all seeing , and made separate The tables . And he straightway , knowing naught , Took of those bodies , eating that which wrought No health for all his race . And when he knew The unnatural deed , back from the board he threw , Spewing that murderous gorge , and spurning brake The table , to make strong the curse he spake : `` Thus perish all of Pleisthenes begot ! '' For that lies this man here ; and all the plot Is mine , most righteously . For me , the third , When butchering my two brethren , Atreus spared And cast me with my broken sire", "that day , A little thing in swaddling clothes , away To exile ; where I grew , and at the last Justice hath brought me home ! Yea though outcast In a far land , mine arm hath reached this king ; My brain , my hate , wrought all the counselling ; And all is well . I have seen mine enemy Dead in the snare , and care not if I die ! LEADER . Aigisthos , to insult over the dead I like not . All the counsel , thou hast said , Was thine alone ; and thine the will that spilled This piteous blood . As justice is fulfilled , Thou shalt not 'scape -- so my heart presageth -- -The day of cursing and the hurled death . AIGISTHOS . How , thou poor oarsman of the nether row , When the main deck is master ? Sayst thou so ? ... To such old heads the lesson may prove hard , I fear me , when Obedience is the word . But hunger , and bonds , and cold , help men to find Their wits. -- They are wondrous healers of the mind ! Hast eyes and seest not this ? -- Against a spike Kick not , for fear it pain thee if thou strike . LEADER ( _turning from him to_ CLYTEMNESTRA ) . Woman ! A soldier fresh from war ! To keep Watch o'er his house and shame him in his sleep ... To plot this craft against a lord of spears ... [ CLYTEMNESTRA , _as though in a dream , pays no heed._ AIGISTHOS _interupts._ AIGISTHOS . These be the words , old man , that lead to tears ! Thou hast an opposite to Orpheus ' tongue , Who chained all things with his enchanting song , For thy mad noise will put the chains on thee . Enough ! Once mastered thou shalt tamer be . LEADER . Thou master ? Is old Argos so accurst ? Thou plotter afar off , who never durst Raise thine own hand to affront and strike him down ... AIGISTHOS . To entice him was the wife 's work . I was known By all men here , his old confessed blood-foe . Howbeit , with his possessions I will know How to be King . And who obeys not me Shall be yoked hard , no easy trace-horse he , Corn-flushed . Hunger , and hunger 's prison mate , The clammy murk , shall see his rage abate . LEADER . Thou craven soul ! Why not in open strife Slay him ? Why lay the blood-sin on his wife , Staining the Gods of Argos , making ill The soil thereof ? ... But young Orestes still Liveth . Oh , Fate will guide him home again , Avenging , conquering , home to kill these twain ! AIGISTHOS . 'Fore God , if 't is your pleasure thus to speak and do , ye soon shall hear ! Ho there , my trusty pikes , advance ! There cometh business for the spear . [ _A body of Spearmen , from concealment outside , rush in and dominate the stage._ ] LEADER . Ho there , ye Men of Argos ! Up ! Stand and be ready , sword from sheath ! AIGISTHOS . By Heaven , I also , sword in hand , am ready , and refuse not death ! LEADER . Come , find it ! We accept thy word . Thou offerest what we hunger for . [ _Some of the Elders draw swords with the Leader ; others have collapsed with weakness . Men from_ AGAMEMNON 'S _retinue have gathered and prepare for battle , when , before they can come to blows , _ CLYTEMNESTRA _breaks from her exhausted silence._ CLYTEMNESTRA . Nay , peace , O best-beloved ! Peace ! And let us work no evil more . Surely the reaping of the past is a full harvest , and not good , And wounds enough are everywhere. -- Let us not stain ourselves with blood . Ye reverend Elders , go your ways , to his own dwelling every one , Ere things be wrought for which men suffer. -- What we did must needs be done . And if of all these strifes we now may have no more , oh , I will kneel And praise God , bruised though we be beneath the Daemon 's heavy heel . This is the word a woman speaks , to hear if any man will deign . AIGISTHOS . And who are these to burst in flower of folly thus of tongue and brain , And utter words of empty sound and perilous , tempting Fortune 's frown , And leave wise counsel all forgot , and gird at him who wears the crown ? LEADER . To cringe before a caitiff 's crown , it squareth not with Argive ways . AIGISTHOS . ( _sheathing his sword and turning from them_ ) . Bah , I will be a hand of wrath to fall on thee in after days . LEADER . Not so , if God in after days shall guide Orestes home again ! AIGISTHOS . I know how men in exile feed on dreams ... and know such food is vain . LEADER . Go forward and wax fat ! Defile the right for this thy little hour ! AIGISTHOS . I spare thee now . Know well for all this folly thou shalt feel my power . LEADER . Aye , vaunt thy greatness , as a bird beside his mate doth vaunt and swell . CLYTEMNESTRA . Vain hounds are baying round thee ; oh , forget them ! Thou and I shall dwell As Kings in this great House . We two at last will order all things well .
